Supported values are listed when hovering over the [V] icon. Comparators, and therefore [[RoR transmitters|Redstone-over-Radio Transmitter]] are limited to interpreting single values as numbers 0 - 15, while the reader can send multiple values with exact precision. For example, connecting the reader to a barrel and reading the \"fill\" value will cause it to send the exact amount of millibuckets in that barrel."
