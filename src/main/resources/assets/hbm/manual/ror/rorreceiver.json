		"en_US": "Basic [[redstone over radio|Redstone over Radio]] receiving device, reads the configured radio signal and outputs a redstone signal based on that. By default, it is set to \"Redstone Passthrough\" which means it will simply try to interpret the signal as a number and produce a matching redstone signal. If set to \"Custom Mapping\", it will instead translate the received value to a redstone signal level. Received signals must match the configured mapping exactly in order to be interpreted, for less precise comparisons, a [[logic receiver|Redstone-over-Radio Logic Receiver]] is required."
