		"en_US": "Basic [[redstone over radio|Redstone over Radio]] transmitting device, reads the redstone signal strength of the block it is connected to (connecting redstone to the torch itself does nothing) and sends a radio signal based on that. If no redstone signal is found, it will act like a comparator, meaning it can read the fill state of chests or barrels and interpret them in increments from 0 to 15. By default, it is set to \"Redstone Passthrough\" which means it will simply send the numeric value of the redstone signal it receives. If set to \"Custom Mapping\", it will instead translate the received value to a specified line of text, and send that text instead. Text that only contains numbers can be interpreted like numbers by receivers that support it."
