		"en_US": "Redstone over radio is a system that allows signals to be sent and received within a dimension, with no delay or distance restrictions. In its most basic form, redstone over radio can be used to send redstone signals with standard impulse strengths of 0 - 15 to control simple mechanisms from afar, however there are no actual restrictions on what exactly a signal can be. Depending on the application, larger numbers or even text can be sent, and interpreted as needed.<br><br>To get a simple RoR setup to work, only a single RoR compatible transmitter and receiver are needed. RoR transmitters for example will, if not configured to do otherwise, simply translate the redstone signal of the block they are connected to into a radio signal with that numeric value, and RoR receivers will turn that numeric radio signal back into a redstone signal.<br><br>Most RoR compatible machines have two operating modes, \"State Change\" and \"Polling\". When set to state change, transmitters will only send one single impulse when their signal changes, and receivers will update their output once they receive such an impulse. This means that, should a transmitter unload or be destroyed, receivers will retain their most recent signal. Polling means that checks are expected every tick, so transmitters will send constantly and receivers will listen constantly, should a transmitter unload or be destroyed, the receiver will immediately lose the signal.<br><br>To send a signal, a frequency must be specified, one frequency can only hold one signal at a time. If multiple signlals are sent on one frequency, the most recent signal is the one that's preferred. There is however an exception to this rule: If there's two numeric signals on the same frequency and within the same tick, the resulting frequency is the sum of all numeric signals being sent.<br><br>Redstone over radio transmitting devices include:<br>* [[Redstone-over-Radio Transmitter]]: The simplest of transmitters, either just sends the strength of a redstone signal, or can use custom redstone strength to text mapping<br>* [[Redstone-over-Radio Item Counter]]: Counts the configured items in a connected container and sends them on the specified frequencies, up to three items can be configured<br>* [[Redstone-over-Radio Reader]]: Can be connected to machines that support it to read values and then send those values over the specified frequencies<br><br>Redstone over radio receiving devices include:<br>* [[Redstone-over-Radio Receiver]]: The simplest receiving device which either receives numerical values and emits them as redstone signals, or maps custom values to redstone signals<br>* [[Redstone-over-Radio Logic Receiver]]: A more advanced receiver that uses a list of logic operations, like comparing numeric values or text, to figure out what redstone signal to emit<br>* [[Redstone-over-Radio Controller]]: An advanced component that can be connected to supporting machines, where it can receive commands with parameters to perform certain actions with that machine<br><br>Additionally, some devices can transmit and receive signals simultaneously:<br>* [[TELEX Machine]]: Wireless communications that can send and receive text, letter by letter"
