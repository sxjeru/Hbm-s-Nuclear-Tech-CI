Particles exceeding 1000 points of defocus will crash, so refocussing using [[quadrupole magnets|Quadrupole Magnets]] is necessary.<br><br>This component requires cooling through [[cold perfluoromethyl|Perfluoromethyl]]. The returned room temperature fluid can be cooled again using [[compressors|Compressor]].<br><br>This component is one-way only, make sure the particle follows the red arrows!"
