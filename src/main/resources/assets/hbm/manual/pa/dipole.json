		"en_US": "Active component of the [[particle accelerator|Particle Accelerator]]. Used to direct particles around corners, which enables loops and branches.<br><br>Dipoles need to be configured to be usable. The first output setting determines the direction of the particle when it does not meet the speed threshold, the second determines the direction if it does, and the third determines the direction if the threshold is met AND a redstone signal is applied to one of the dipole's ports. Below the direction settings is a text field for configuring the threshold speed. <br><br>Ideally, the threshold should be set below the upper limit of the coils used in the same accelerator ring. This causes the particle to leave the ring before it can exceed the coil's maximum speed and crash.<br><br>This component uses [[large coils|Large Coil]], keep coil restrictions in mind when building the accelerator!<br><br>This component requires cooling through [[cold perfluoromethyl|Perfluoromethyl]]. The returned room temperature fluid can be cooled again using [[compressors|Compressor]]."
