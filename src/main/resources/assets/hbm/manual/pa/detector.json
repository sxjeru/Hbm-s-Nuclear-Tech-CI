Requires empty capsules to catch the resulting particles, inputs are simply voided if the particle cannot be collected. Particle detection requires a defocus of 0, ensure that the accelerator has sufficient [[quadrupoles|Quadrupole Magnets]].<br><br>This component requires cooling through [[cold perfluoromethyl|Perfluoromethyl]]. The returned room temperature fluid can be cooled again using [[compressors|Compressor]]."
