## Changed
* The powder combination recipe for steel powder now yields steel scraps instead, meaning that it has to be smelted either via crucible or arc furnace
  * In addition, there is now an alternate recipe combining four times the material, yielding larger steel scraps, allowing for higher throughput
* The new autogen wire items now use texture overrides, restoring the original textures
* Arc furnaces now start burning on the inside as the electrodes are inserted, making the process look a lot more violent

## Fixed
* Removed sand to silicon AE2 compat recipe which caused sand to be shreddable into the new silicon wafers, skipping the arc furnace entirely
* Fixed shift clicking into the arc furnace placing the entire stack into a single slot, ignoring stacksize limitations
