* Telex
  * A basic message system using redstone over radio
  * Allows messages to be sent at a rate of 20 characters per second
  * Features things like text formatting, printing and the terminal bell
* Ground water pumps
  * Come in steam-powered and electric variants
  * Faster than their infinite barrel counterpart
  * Need to be placed below Y:70 and on solid ground to work
  * Compatible floor blocks include all dirt variants and sand, the pump will not work when placed on pure rock
* Schrabidate capacitor
  * Can store 50GHE
* Express conveyor belts
  * Work like regular single-lane conveyor belts but 3x faster
* Industrial smokestack
  * An even larger smokestack, matching the size of the coker unit
  * Reduced pollution by 90%, as opposed to the brick smokestack's 75%

## Changed
* Updated russian localization
* The UAC pistol's UV now looks prettier
* The UAC pistol now fires a burst on right click
* CCGTs can no longer have smoke removed from them, on the count of there not being enough connections anyway. The pollution rate is now equivalent to three small furnaces
* The DFC receiver is now crafted with a block of DNT instead of sellafite corium, on the count of sellafite corium being near impossible to get
* Fireclay now has a third recipe, being craftable from clay, limestone and sand
* A whole clay block can now be combination smelted into a block of bricks
* The pipe clanking sound is now also used when placing regular pipes as opposed to only when pre-defined pipe items are used
* Josh now has a burst fire mode using RMB
* The smokestack's recipe has changed, now requiring a steel grate for catching ashes
* Simplified the decorated cobalt tool recipes, they now only require one cobalt tool and one hot bar of meteorite in an anvil
* Changed the starmetal tool recipes
* Cobalt armor is now crafted with steel armor and cobalt billets, making the armor substantially cheaper
* Sightly increased protection levels for the security armor and cobalt gear
* Cobalt, decorated cobalt and starmetal gear is now a lot more enchantable
* The ashpit now has a NEI handler, showing roughly how ash types are made
* Smokestacks now capture fly ash and are now compatible with ashpits
* Industrial smokestacks can also capture fine soot
* Reduced strings required for making coal filters, filters are now also available in tier 2 anvils

## Fixed
* Fixed the bomber not spawning if the chunkloading radios is too small
* Fixed a couple spelling mistakes like BFB fuel being called ZFB and the broken ZIRNOX
* Potentially fixed a compat issue where galacticraft moon soil isn't shreddable into NTM moon turf
* Hopefully fixed the disappearing fluid bug once and for all
* Fixed lag caused by the radiation system needlessly loading chunks
* Fixed secret folders giving volatile templates instead of persistent ones
* Fixed the ore dict registry happening in a later loading phase instead of PreInit which should fix some compatibility issues
* Hopefully fixed issue where the tom impact effects will last even when switching worlds
* Fixed logspam caused by custom machine crafting handler
* Fixed issue with the assemblers and chemplants where recipes with larger input requirements would break the input funnel
* Fixed crash caused by reloading when the ammo item is in the last slot
