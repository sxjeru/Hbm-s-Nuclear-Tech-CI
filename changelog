## Added
* Acidizer Input Partitioner
  * Buffers inputs for the ore acidizer and releases the exact amount needed to complete an operation
  * This allows easy automation of acidizers accepting multiple types which have higher input requirements
  * By simply shoving items into the acidizer all at once, there is a high likelyhood of the acidizer to clog, as the remaining input is no longer sufficient
  * The partitioner only has 9 slots for ingredients, for more types it's necessary to sort the items and use multiple partitioners
  * The partitioner has 9 additional slots for invalid items that cannot be processed via acidizer, those can be ejected via hopper IO
  * An inline conveyor machine similar to the splitter, receives items from conveyors (but not from ejectors directly) and outputs them on its built-in conveyor belt

## Changed
* The mandatory washing step for bedrock ore byproducts now needs 4 items for sulfuric, 12 for dissolved and 24 for cleaned byproducts (isntead of just one)
  * This should offset the exponentially increasing amount of byproduct created from processing bedrock ore which ends up being far greater than the primary product

## Fixed
* Added a write lock o cellular dungeons while generating, fixing a crash caused by dungeons that generate next to each other due to cascading worldgen
* Added recipe caching to the arc furnace, fixing an issue where recipe detection and item IO are horribly inefficient
