## Changed
* Updated russian localization
* Nerfed conventional explosives (dynamite, TNT, semtex, C4) in order to not outclass small nukes
* Plastic explosive blocks no longer drop and blocks
* Sellafite diamond ore now shreds into diamond gravel
* ICF vessel blocks now use half as much fullerite as before
* ICF capacitor and turbocharger blocks are now quite a bit cheaper
