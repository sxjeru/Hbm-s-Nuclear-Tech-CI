## Changed
* QMAW now has buttons for returning to previously viewed pages
* QMAW file detection now includes subfolders to `manual`
* OpenComputers integration for the ZIRNOX should now return values in Â°C and bar instead of unexplained weird internal units

## Fixed
* Fixed QMAW not working at all
* Potentially fixed a bug where proxy tile entities would reference unloaded core tile entities which would cause bizarre item voiding/duping issues in rare cases
* Fixed fusion reactor automation being able to remove items other than the breeding output slot
* Fixed chunkloading transport drones getting stuck due to off-by-one rounding errors
