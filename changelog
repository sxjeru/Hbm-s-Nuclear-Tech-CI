## Changed
* Changed the multi fluid ID recipe, they now use analog circuits instead of silicon based ones, no longer requiring plastic to make
* Decreased the connection speed for all battery blocks, a full discharge now takes 30 seconds instead of 1 second, and charging now takes 10 seconds
  * Capacitors have also been nerfed but they are twice as fast as battery blocks, 5 seconds for charging and 15 seconds for discharging
* Removed forgotten bricks
* Updated CMB brick texture

## Fixed
* Fixed pumpjack gauges not syncing properly
* Fixed some concrete variants not being revertable into uncolored concrete
