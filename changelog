## Added
* Bauxite processing
  * Bauxite is now processed by mixing it with lye, and then fractioning it into sodium aluminate and red mud
  * Red mud can now be turned into cement
  * Sodium aluminate can either be processed directly into aluminium in a rotary furnace, or turned into alumina with fluorite to be used in an electrolyzer
  * Standard aluminium ore is now "aluminium-bearing ore" which drops cryolite, which can either be smelted into aluminium like normal or combination smelted into aluminium and lye
* Particle accelerator
  * Should be about finished now
  * Recipes should now be doable
  * Added recipes to all the components
  * Changed the dipole mechanic from a momentum penalty to a power draw penalty for smaller accelerator rings
  * Added explicit compressor recipes for perfluoromethyl in order to change the standard compression speed of 100 ticks to 50
  * All the parts have tooltips, you'll figure it out

## Changed
* Blast doors will now pulverize any block that gets in their way during closing
* The nuclear and RTG furnaces will be retired, their recipes have been removed but they remain operational for now
* Changed the magnetron recipe to be 3 copper plates and 4 tungsten wires
* Added recipes to some secret ammo types

## Fixed
* Fixed the CCGT's steam output breaking as soon as the steam buffer runs full
* Fixed crash caused by mobs holding belt-fed guns
* Fixed boiler heat input being way too low due to operation order (diffusion was applied AFTER the input heat was capped)
* Fixed stinger playing its lockon sound on the wrong side
