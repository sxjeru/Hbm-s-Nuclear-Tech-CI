## Added
* New assembler
  * Features a brand new animated model, GUI and the new recipe selection system
  * Many recipes have been reworked, with the microcrafting complexity reduced
  * The redcoil didn't get a recipe. It's gonna die soon.
  * Neither did the schrabidium transmutator
  * Balls-o-tron's spawner can now be made without a worm coin, using a silver key instead. This means that, while expensive, it's possible to summon him without finding a jungle dungeon
* Blueprins
  * Replace the journals
  * Instead of opening them and making a template, they act as a multi template
  * Blueprints need to remain in the slot, removing them will disable the recipes again

## Changed
* Removed levitation unit
* Many of NTM's regular building blocks now have forge microblock support
* RBMK crane models now conform to the dimensions of the room they're in
* Projectile resistance for armor has been renamed to "physical" and now also extends to all direct forms of attack by other entities that don't fall into any other categories (mostly melee attacks)
  * This should fix the issue where most armors are quite weak against swords
* Electric attacks (i.e. tesla cannon) are now in the "energy damage" category
  * This means that armors that have energy resistance actually properly work against the tesla cannon

## Fixed
* Fixed gas centrifuge sound persisting when broken or when unloaded
* Fixed all centrifuge sounds trying to play even when the player is far away, using up audio slots
* Fixed guns that don't have durability always displaying a condition of 0%
