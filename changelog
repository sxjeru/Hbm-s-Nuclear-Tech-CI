## Added
* PWR
  * The successor to the old large nuclear reactor
  * Has some design similarities with the RBMK, but in 3D
  * Relatively easy to build and safe to operate
  * Does not use any tile entity rendering and all math is pre-calculated when the reactor is assembled, making this one even more performant than the old large reactor
  * Balancing might change, so keep that in mind when updating in the future
* Sodalite
  * A gem that can be extracted from fluorite or lapis ore
  * Can be heated in the combination oven to make sodium and chlorine
* Liquid sodium
  * Valid PWR coolant with high efficiency rating
  * Made by liquefacting sodium
* Liquid thorium salt
  * Valid PWR coolant
  * Has a high flux multiplication rate, boosting fuels
  * After cooling, the depleted salt has to be reprocessed using a chemical plant
* Creative stirling engine
  * A stirling engine with 100% efficiency and no heat cap
  * Still has the 10% delta-T heat transfer rate as the other stirlings
  * Great for quickly benchmarking reactors without needing to set up a turbine cycle

## Changed
* Bedrock fluorite ore now yields actual ore instead of fluorite directly
* Blocks that fall from fallout effects no longer drop items when falling on small blocks, preventing issues like gas blocks being dropped
* Bullets no longer need primers to be crafted, primers no longer exist at all
* The automatic buzzsaw can now use wood oil, ethanol, fish oil and heavy oil to run
* Fluorite ore is now centrifugable
* Fluorite crystals now centrifuge into slightly less fluorite but also yield sodalite
* Blast resistance values for most resistant blocks have been changed, most blocks now have much lower resistance which means there's now a practical difference between concrete and ducrete. Resistance values also match the block's cost more closely.
* Using a screwdriver, the input and output sides of conveyor cranes (inserters, ejectors, etc) can now be configured, allowing them to operate around corners
* Sandstone's blast resistance is now as high as stone's, but only against nuclear explosions
* The tsar bomba model has been updated
* The nuclear explosion animation has been replaced with the TOREX system, instead of a static model that moves around, the mushroom clouds are now made of simulated particles
* Sellafite now uses random ticks instead of scheduled ticks every second, while this does reduce its radioactivity quite a bit, it prevents the tick queue from slowing down to a crawl with large amounts of sellafite from nuclear explosions
* Conveyor blocks now have tooltips explaining what they do and how they can be configured
* The large reactor still works despite the PWR being added, but the parts have been made uncraftable
* Unused watz parts have been hidden from the creative inventory
* Removed the bedrok coltan ore, since it was replaced by generic bedrock ores anyway
* Updated decal on the congo lake grenade launcher

## Fixed
* Fixed FEnSU's IO limit not working properly
* Fixed overflow caused by uncapped Spk values of DFC beams, they are now capped at 9,200,000 Spk
* Fixed smooth lighting not working on connected textures
* Fixed the Thermos preventer not working on Crucible type servers
* Fixed pollution save files not working correctly on certain Thermos forks
* Fixed blast furnace output overstacking
* Fixed potential crash caused by centrifuges trying to create a recipe using non-registered items
* Fixed chemplant GUI crashing when too many upgrades are applied to a short duration recipe
* Corium is now a finite fluid, fixing an issue where a single fuel rod can be used to create a giant blob of corium, lagging out the server
* Fixed bullets not being able to pass things like tall grass
* Whether the player has received a guide book is now saved as part of the extprop which might fix an issue where offline mode players get a new book on every start
* Fixed electrolyser fluid recipes not showing the input amount
