## Added
* Boxcables
  * Like boxducts, but for power

## Changed
* Updated meteors
  * Meteors will now punch through weak blocks like leaves instead of getting stuck on trees
  * Meteor impacts now have new visuals
  * Falling meteors will produce a sound instead of stealthily blowing people up
  * Fallen meteors will now be placed deeper into the actual crater instead of hovering awkwardly over the hole
* Addd QMAW pages for the particle accelerator parts along with a PA overview page and a simple step by step construction tutorial
* Increased the acidizer partitioner's input limit from 9 to 45 slots

## Fixed
* Fixed arc furnace only allowing electrodes to be inserted when the lid is down instead of up
* Fixed issue where the `amounts` tracker wasn't being used correctly when using a custom acidizer config, preventing the acidizer partitioner from working
* Fixed multi fluid ID search potentially not working on systems with a non-latin locale
