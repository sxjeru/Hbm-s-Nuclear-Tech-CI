## Added
* More custom machine parts
  * Custom machines now have a neutron acceptor which allows them to use flux from the breeding reactor in recipes
  * There is now a heat acceptor which can accept heat from things like fireboxes or electric heaters
  * Also added a config option to create pollution
* Hydrotreater
  * Tier 3 oil machine (on the same level as vacuum oil and reforming)
  * Can de-sulfurize oil, which allows extraction of sour gas directly from crude oil
  * Using desulfurized oil skips the (rather destructive) desulfurization process of the standard refinery, yielding higher-quality oils
  * Hydrotreating also allows cracked diesel variants to turn into their normal counterparts
  * Can convert coal oil directly into coal gasoline
  * For people afraid that this means yet another oil expansion that they need to progress through, I can assure you that this machine is entirely optional
* Rural house
  * A new structure of an old brick house
* Industrial lighting
  * Three new lamps that project out a beam of light for more coverage
  * Cage lamps are made from tungsten filaments and project light by 2 additional blocks
  * Fluorescent lights are made from mercury and project light 8 blocks, they also connect with each other to form light strips
  * Halogen floodlights are made with bromine and cast a light beam 32 blocks long
  * Lights are on by default and can be toggled with redstone
  * Tritium lamps have also been retrofitted with longer range lighting, casting beams in all cardinal directions for 8 blocks
* Launch pad
  * The standard launch pad is now a 9x9 platform that changes depending on what missile is loaded
  * Missiles now have to be fueled like they would need to be on custom missile launchers
  * The old launch pad has been renamed to silo launch pad and has kept the same rough shape
  * Launch pads can still receive missiles from hoppers, however they now have a loading delay, making missiles no longer spammable from a single launch pad
  * Large launch pads have to physically lift and place the rocket onto the pad, while the silo launch pad has a refueling delay
  * Custom missiles are not yet usable on the new launch pad, for now they still require the dedicated custom missile launch pads
* Large silo hatch
  * Because the new nuclear missile model is too fat, there's now a larger silo hatch
  * Has a 7x7 footprint and a 5x5 opening
* Bedrock ores for neodymium and rare earth chunks

## Changed
* Deco bocks now drop all of the time, but they drop themselves instead of ingots
  * To get the ingots, deco blocks now have to be deconstructed in the anvil, yielding an ingot 25% of the time
  * If I see one more person complaining about the chances I'm reducing it down to 10%
* Catalytic reformers now have a tooltip informing about the need for a catalytic converter
* Several guns now have reload animations including most .357 revolvers and Samuel
* Updated stealth missile texture
* Some of the larger oil machines now render using display lists which should make them somewhat more performant
* Glyphid diggers can no longer yeet multiblocks or blocks with a tile entity
* Parasite-infested glyphids now explode into gore when the parasites pop out
* Missiles now have a top acceleration twice as much as the previous acceleration, but instead of being static, the acceleration goes up from 0 to max within 3 seconds
  * This makes missiles reach top speed faster while also making the launches themselves slower and more pleasant
* Strange stone can no longer be destroyed via AoE, making it easier to find without accidentally mining it
* Launch pads now spawn launch smoke just like custom missile compact launchers
* Remodeled all tier 0 missiles
* Tier 0 missiles now have a much thinner contrail to match their size better
* Covneyor ejectors can now eject sulfur out of the side ports of refineries
* Refineries and vacuum refineries now have fluid ID slots for changing the recipe
* Removed the remaining old oil separation recipes from the chemical plant
  * To help people coping with this terrible, terrible loss, fraction towers are now twice as fast
  * This is a reminder that the chemical plant is a chemical reactor first and foremost, recipes like mixing and fractioning only existed because at the time there was no dedicated machine for it
  * Fractional distilling is not a chemical process but a purely physical one, I don't know who needs to know this but I feel like some people might be unaware of the fact
* More large models have been converted into display lists which should improve performance somewhat
* Corroded barrels now crumble after a while
* PWRs on the edge of unloaded chunks now additionally reset their internal heat value to further reduce the time until they can potentially melt down
* Removed the assembly recipe for the radial engine since it will be retired soon
* Removed the endo and exothermal missiles
* Doomsday missiles are no longer laggy cluster missiles, instead they are now near-identical to thermonuclear missiles but with an added fallout radius of 100#
* Fallout rain now uses the same variable length code that the MK5 uses for optimal tick utilization, making it a lot faster
* Lighter sellafite variants should no longer replace darker ones in overlapping craters, making bombed-out landscapes look more natural
* Fallout's range-based effects now have a more natural gradient instead of creating smooth rings
* Fallout has been made significantly darker and less saturated to blend in with the crater more
* Except for solid fueled missiles, all missiles are now fueled in the launch pad and no longer need to be crafted with fuel
* Missile fuel types have been adjusted
  * Tier 0: Solid Fuel
  * Tier 1: Ethanol + Peroxide
  * Tier 2: Kerosene + Peroxide
  * Tier 3: Kerosene + LOXY
  * Tier 4: Jet Fuel + LOXY
* The micro EMP has been made cheaper, while the schrabidium missile has been made more expensive
* Oxyhydrogen can now be made by mixing air (i.e. nothing) with hydrogen
  * The oxygen + hydrogen recipe remains in order to give an option to void oxygen without needing to resort to flare stacks
* Removed some of the lower tier items fomr the red room loot pool, making the average red room better
* Retextured the fallout effect, fallout no longer has large snowflakes and the color now matches the crater better
* High-yield mini nukes no longer create chunk radiation, since they use the MK5 which already has AoE radiation, this prevents dead grass from spawning that makes the crater look uglier
* Balefire spread is now limited to prevent densely vegetated biomes from lagging to hell
* The bricked furnace now makes charcoal twice as fast
* Combination ovens no longer need two welded copper plates and instead only cast plates, therefore no longer being post-arc welder. This should make it more affordable and useful in the initial earlygame where things like automatic wood farms are most important.
* Any water-like extinguishing fluid shot from the chemical thrower can now wash away fallout layers
* Overhauled the Mk.III life extender
  * The assembler recipe has been replaced with a simpler but more expensive workbench recipe
  * Instead of taking up the chestplate slot, it's now an armor mod worn in the insert slot
  * The armor no longer gives absorption, instead it adds 25 points to the shield count
  * The +25 bypasses the shield limit of 100, meaning that with enough shield infusions, the total maximum is now 125
* The likelihood of uranium ore turning into schrabidium from full-sized nukes is now 10% instead of 1%. Conversion rates for small dirty explosions such as radioactive barrels remain unchanged.
* Fallout layers will no longer affect players in creative mode
* Rare earth chunks are now centrifugable, yielding larger quantities of the elements that are most needed earlier in the game
* Tier 3 missilles no longer need large fuel tanks and thrusters, instead they use two medium fuel tanks and four medium thrusters
* Tier 4s now need three thrusters
* Tier 0 missiles now come pre-fueled with solid fuel as part of their recipe
* Updated the ABM recipe to use the act welder, being made of a tier 0 missile assembly with extra thrusters and loaded with TNT/TATB
* The super shotgun now has improved animations, and is centered like it is in the original DOOM games
* 

## Fixed
* Fixed dupe caused by shift-clicking ashes out of the bricked furnace
* Fixed missiles jerkingly rotating when launching, they should now smoothly transition from being part of the launch pad to being an entity
* Fixed missile control and launch smoke shifting around when the player is moving
* Fixed fast-moving missiles spawning too few particles, causing holes in the contrail
* Fixed coker units creating soot when not processing anything
* Foundry molds can no longer be removed from basins when there's still material in them, fixing a bug where doing so would void the material
* Fixed molds not saving when cooling off, allowing to dupe metal when leaving and rejoining
* Fixed normal drones loading chunks
* Fixed chunk-loading drones not loading chunks
* Fixed several chemistry templates missing names
* Fixed rampant mode random scout spawns being able to appear inside blocks
* Fixed turret rotation sometimes desyncing when out of range, this is especially noticeable with slow-moving arty
* Fixed research reactor OC integration allowing the control rods to be set out of bounds
* Fixed fallout falling faster and overlaying if multiple fallout areas intersect
* Fixed template folder 3D models rendering with weird shading
* HUD elements like jetpack charge and the shield bar should now still render even if Tinker's Construct replaces the health bar renderer
* Fixed players glitching into blocks with larger bounding box when standing on top of them and relogging
* Fixed a rare crash caused by doors on chunk borders
