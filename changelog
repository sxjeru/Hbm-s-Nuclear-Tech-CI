## Changed
* Updated boxducts
  * All boxducts are now way cleaner, only having bolts on intersections, with straight parts only having very light seams
  * Intersections now have unique textures for each size
  * Copper boxducts now have a much nicer color gradient
  * Exhaust pipes now have a more rusted appearance
* Added an alternate recipe for blank upgrades using integrated circuits and polymer instead of analog circuits
* Update the soyuz and orbital module recipes
  * Simplified the recipes, fewer microcrafting parts
  * Both now use low-density elements which are made from aluminium/titanium, fiberglass and hard plastic
  * Both now make use of more advanced electronics, although in smaller numbers
* Removed the recipes for the satellite deco blocks, those will be phased out soon. Existing deco blocks can still be crafted back into functional satellites
* Moved the satellite recipes to the welder, the attachment is now welded onto the common satellite body
* Simplified the satellite recipes, adjusted cost based on utility (depth scanner, death ray and resonator are more expensive than the mapper/radar)

## Fixed
* Crash caused by PRISM updating unloaded worlds
