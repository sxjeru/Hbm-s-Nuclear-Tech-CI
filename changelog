## Added
* PWR Heatsink
  * Increases the core heat capacity by 5% per block
  * Makes cooling channels and heat exchangers slightly less effective (each heatsink counts as one quarter of a fuel rod in the heat calculation)

## Changed
* All launch pad blocks can now accept items, not just ports
* Removed the old watz pellets and titanium filter
* Removed copper panels, cast copper plates now take its place in most use-cases
* Removed the steam batteries (why did we even have those?)
* Large and small shells have been merged into a single item which uses material autogen
  * A copper variant for shells has been added which is used for artillery shells
  * Shells are now only directly craftable via anvil, however they can be cast using the crucible as well
* Most instances of the expensive steel pipes as well as the decorative pipes which need tons of microcrafting have been replaced with a new pipe item
  * The new pipes also use autogen, being available in different materials
  * Some of the recipes that used the small shells now use pipes instead

## Fixed
* Fixed crash caused by invalid default loot pool configuration
* Fixeed enchantment glint not rendering on upscaled items like certain swords or tier 2 pickaxes
