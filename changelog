## Added
* Analysis tool
  * A more universal version of the power net analyzer
  * Currently only works on fluid networks though
  * In addition to seeing links and subscribers, the analysis tool also displays subscriber positions as well as a log (up to 50 entries) of what block received how much fluid
  * This should finally give more insight in the bug that rarely causes fluids to disappear
* Leadburster
  * A 40mm launcher grenade that doesn't explode, instead it attaches itself to a block and starts firing bullets
  * Fires in circles for 2 seconds before it self-destructs
* Congo lake
  * A 40mm pump-action grenade launcher with a capacity of 4 rounds
* Lantern
  * Cheap and fancy illumination
  * Will blind glyphids in a small radius
  * Glyphids don't actually have eyes, just don't think about it too much
* Ashpit
  * An optional part that can be placed under fireboxes and heating ovens
  * Collects ashes, producing one ash pile for every 10 furnace operations worth of fuel
  * Ash comes in different types like wood (from planks, logs and saplings), coal (coal, lignite and coke) and generic (everything else)
  * Ashes can be used as dyes, for making industrial fertilizer, as low-efficiency furnace fuel or for carbon in the crucible
  * Coal ashes can also be centrifuged, returning the flammable content as unburned coal dust as well as a small amount of boron

## Changed
* Updated polish and chinese localization
* Flechettes now get stuck in blocks for a few seconds
* NBT kits now display the amount of items in a stack
* Removed the special nuclear meteorite

## Fixed
* Fixed thermos crashing config hitting before the config is saved, resulting in an empty config the first time the server is launched
* Fixed heating oven not visually connecting to exhaust pipes
* Fixed loot blocks not correctly rendering items that require multiple render passes
* Fixed special meteorites spawning in worldgen
