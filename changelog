## Changed
* Changed bedrock ore processing time in the electrolyzer to 60 ticks
* RF converters have been reworked
  * The conversion ratio from HE to RF is now 5:1 (instead of 1:4), HE is no longer way more powerful (in order to compensate for the much higher HE output starting with the first generators and becoming increasingly absurd with nuclear power)
  * Converters have an internal buffer again, effectively limiting throughput. The internal buffer is 1MRF and 5MHE.
  * The input energy buffer has a loss of 5% of its (unused) current level per tick, which means chaining up converters can not be abused to create earlygame super capacitors
  * The loss only takes effect once the input buffer can no longer empty into the output buffer, i.e. when energy demand is too low for the input
  * The buffer also fixes a bug where the HE to RF converter often behaves weirdly with certain mods, either outright destroying energy ot creating infinite energy
  * HE to RF converters now by default have the connection priority of LOW, only feeding into RF networks when all other energy consumers are sufficiently supplied. This can still be changed by using diodes

## Fixed
* Fixed issue where the NEI universal handler can not correctly display more than 4 outputs (now supports up to 8, which should cover all possible electrolyzer cases too)
* Fixed the metal electrolysis duration variable not being part of the config
* Removed the global energy transfer cap (only per-machine caps apply now), fixing issues where FENSUs in buffer mode would not charge past 10THE, and constantly void energy if above that threshold
