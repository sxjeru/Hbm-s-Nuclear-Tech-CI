## Added
* PWR
  * The successor to the old large nuclear reactor
  * Has some design similarities with the RBMK, but in 3D
  * Relatively easy to build and safe to operate
  * Does not use any tile entity rendering and all math is pre-calculated when the reactor is assembled, making this one even more performant than the old large reactor
* Sodalite
  * A gem that can be extracted from fluorite ore
  * Can be heated in the combination oven to make sodium dust and chlorine

## Changed
* Bedrock fluorite ore now yields actual ore instead of fluorite directly
* Blocks that fall from fallout effects no longer drop items when falling on small blocks, preventing issues like gas blocks being dropped
* Bullets no longer need primers to be crafted, primers no longer exist at all
* The automatic buzzsaw can now use wood oil, ethanol, fish oil and heavy oil to run
* Fluorite ore is now centrifugable
* Fluorite crystals now centrifuge into slightly less fluorite but also yield sodalite

## Fixed
* Fixed FEnSU's IO limit not working properly
* Fixed overflow caused by uncapped Spk values of DFC beams, they are now capped at 9,200,000 Spk
* Fixed smooth lighting not working on connected textures
* Fixed the Thermos preventer not working on Crucible type servers
* Fixed pollution save files not working correctly on certain Thermos forks
* Fixed blast furnace output overstacking
* Fixed potential crash caused by centrifuges trying to create a recipe using non-registered items
* Fixed chemplant GUI crashing when too many upgrades are applied to a short duration recipe
