## Added
* Two new anti-material rifle variants
  * .50 BMG demolisher rounds are finally usable
  * Added a special ammo type exclusive to one of the variants
* Starmetal .50 BMG now returns
  * Overall better armor piercing stats than DU
  * Not compatible with the M2, only usable in amat rifles
* Reworked chemical plant
  * No longer needs template items for everything, comes with a convenient recipe selector GUI
  * Three item and three fluids for in and outputs

## Changed
* The RBMK console's grid can now be rotated using a screwdriver
* Tool abilities have changed
  * Right-clicking while holding ALT now opens a configuration window
  * The configuration window allows creation of tool presets
  * Area and block abilities can now be toggled independently from each other. For example, the vein miner ability can be combined with silk touch
  * Clicking on the same ability allows switching between levels
* Updated textures for the armor and gun modification tables
* Ported the fire extinguisher to the SEDNA gun system, eliminating the final remaining ItemGunBase gun
* Water extinguishers can now wash away foam blocks
* Obliterated Fabsol's vodka
* Tier 4 heart piece is now called "heart of darkness"
* Thermal sights now render dead mobs in black
* Guns now have unique scope overlays instead of reusing the .44 scope for everything
* The new chemplant has slightly altered recipes
  * Very basic mixing recipes (e.g. coolant) have been removed, it's now required to use the mixer
  * Water to hydrogen peroxide is now 1,000 : 1,000 (instead of 1,000 : 800)
  * Sulfuric acid's peroxide requirement has been adjusted accordingly
  * Nitric acid has an alternate recipe using air and water, however it takes 4x as long and has a base consumption of 2kHE/t
  * Desh now only takes 10 seconds to produce instead of 15
  * Laminate now only takes 50mB of either fluid per recipe and processes much quicker
  * Ducrete now uses U238 in the form of ferrouranium, and no longer requires gravel at all
  * All recipes for nuclear fuel production now have a higher base consumption
  * Cordite now uses sawdust instead of wood planks and sugar
  * Kevlar is now made from aromatics, nitric acid and chlorine (or phosgene in 528 mode)
  * Electrolysis using the chemplant has been removed. Hydrogen can be made using water and coal (or coke), and oxygen can be distilled from intake air
  * Solid nuclear waste can also be vitrified now
  * Thorium salt reprocessing now only has a 50% chance to produce a U233 nugget and a 25% chance to produce nuclear waste, making it less absurdly powerful and easier to deal with the waste
  * Glyphid meat processing is now less autistic
  * Making rusty steel now only takes 2 seconds per recipe
  * Perfluoromethyl can now also be made in the chemical plant (technically, the process isn't just simple mixing after all)
* Removed niter to nitric acid liquefaction recipe

## Fixed
* Conveyor ejectors should now correctly place items onto the back of splitters instead of on the output belts
* Fixed strand caster fluid gauges going out of bounds
* Fixed arc welder and soldering station not changing buffer size based on upgrade, preventing use of higher overdrive tiers
* Fixed non-standard template folder recipes not using the correct icon
* Fixed jetpack flight time not resetting when equipped like armor, causing kicks on servers that don't have flying cheats allowed
* Fixed missing energy damage category localization
* Fixed server crash caused by tool abilities
* Fixed chunkloading entities not releasing their loading tickets properly
* Potentially fixed a dupe issue related to tool abilities
