## Added
* Gylphid pheromones
  * Used by certain glyphids, killing those allows for the pheromone glands to be harvested
  * By mixing the pheromone with blood and medicine, it can be modified to extend its positive effects to non-glyphid entities
* Disperser canisters
  * Throwable like grenades, will cause a small AoE effect based on the fluid
  * Effectively a gas grenade, allows phosgene and mustard gas to be used directly
  * Hot things like hot coolant or steam are especially effective

## Changed
* Reworked glyphids
  * Hives are no longer open, instead they are much flatter with multiple spawners inside
  * Naturally spawning hives now spawn with some loot inside
  * Spawners now place glyphids nearby instead of on top, preventing them from suffocating instantly
  * Glyphids no longer spawn every second, instead they spawn in waves
  * More config option for spawning behavior
  * A new config option for rampant mode which makes glyphids more aggressive, scouts expand directly towards players and all glyphids able to dig away obstacles
  * A dedicated glyphid for digging also exists outside of rampant mode
  * Glyphid meat can now be processed into resources
  * Glyphid behemoths now have an acid attack and create a gas effect on death
  * Larger glyphids can now destroy lanterns
  * Infested glyphids
    * 10% of all glyphid hives will be infested
    * Infested glyphids are roughly equal, but apply a poison effect and nausea when attacking
    * When killed, they will drop maggots that attack the player
    * Infested scouts will also create infested hives
* Glyphid hive blocks no longer drop when broken
* The industrial generator no longer has an exponential modifier for power generation, which means it no longer produces several times more power than any other generator
* The igen by default only burns with 50% efficiency, which can be raised back to 100% with water and even to 125% with lubricant, making it slightly better when lubed than the fluid burner

## Fixed
* Fixed the info system not being visible with a gun equipped
* Fixed a potential crash with suit batteries
