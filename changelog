## Changed
* Any bullet that can ricochet (or at least runs the code for it) can now also break glass
* Removed three old achievements which no longer work due to the gun changes
* AJR armor plating now uses niobium instead of saturnite, and yields twice as many items per recipe
* Due to the gating change, the saturnite anvil now has a tier equivalent to a bronze anvil
* Doubled the liberator's base damage to be on-par with the lever action shotgun in order to offset its poor performance due to the reload speed
* All non black powder shotgun shells now have some amount of damage threshold negation in order to not immediately become useless when used against early power armor
  * Obviously shot will always fare worse against higher tier armor, in those cases either use flechettes, slugs, any of the high tier rounds or a different caliber entirely
* Bombers and cargo planes now use interpolation, making their movement smoother and fixing potential desyncs due to TPS

## Fixed
* Fixed 9mm soft points being called ".9mm"
* Fixed missing localization for the hard plastic and PVC autogen materials
* Fixed the fat mine's crafting recipe still using the deprecated ammo item
* Removed legacy ammo items and guns from all remaining item pools
* Fixed the rubber grip not having a recipe
* Fixed the coilgun and bolter not being classified correctly
* Fixed new death messages not working
* Fixed none of the armors having fall resistance
* Fixed survey scanners not picking up nether depth rock
* Fixed FMJ, AP and DU rounds not having damage threshold negation, making them worse against most armored targets compared to JHP
* Fixed autgen items made from unsmeltable materials being smeltable in the crucible
* Fixed 240mm shells not being visible in creative
* Fixed JHP's negative armor piercing value not being counted right, breaking the "armor is worth more" system
* Fixed the second UZI dealing more damage than it should
* Potentially fixed an issue where artillery rockets would sometimes get stuck mid-air
* Fixed the artillery rocket turret's grace range not being 250 as advertised
