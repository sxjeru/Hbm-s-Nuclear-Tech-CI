## Added
* T-51b power armor
  * Serves as a replacement for the T-45

## Changed
* Added more QMAW pages
* Removed most old particle accelerator blocks from the creative inventory
* All dual wielded guns now render more accurately when dropped instead of only showing one gun
* Added support for left handed guns (currently unused)*
* Removed the presentations for the old particle accelerator and schottky diode
* Gibbing NPCs now also spawns bones, if supported by the skeletonizer
  * Gibbed bones only have a 50% chance of spawning and come with a unique red texture
  * Gibbed bones have a way shorter lifetime and higher gravity to match the gib particles
* Updated the factory structure
* NBT based structures now have a config for the spawn weight, unlike the old structure configs, higher numbers make structures more frequent
* Mobs are no longer registered in the vanilla namespace
* Drills no longer clip through depth rock, depth rock now has to be cleared before bedrock ore becomes accessible
* When an area modifier is selected on a tool, an icon will now render next to the crosshair to make it obvious that the modifier is active

## Fixed
* Fixed wood burner only being able to create one ash pile per item burned, even when that item yields more, creating a backlog in the internal ash value
* Fixed some QMAW link icons not having the correct block lighting applied
* Fixed a rare crash caused by RBMK neutron calculations happening in unloaded chunks
