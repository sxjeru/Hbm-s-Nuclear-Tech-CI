## Added
* N I 4 N I
  * It's that one gun from that one game, you throw coins and your shots bounce around
  * Needs no introduction
  * Can be upgraded with nickels or gold doubloons for more pocket change to yeet
  * Found in airdrop supply crates, about 10x rarer than a double barrel shotgun
* More structures
  * I haven't even looked at them so it's a surprise for everyone
* PWR printer
  * Using it on a PWR controller will cause the game to generate images of each layer of the reactor

## Changed
* Updated ukrainian, chinese and russian localization, including QMAW
* Some previously hardcoded lang strings are now affected by translations
* Due to severe issues with ticking order as well as a crash caused by certain tiles that uses threaded packets, Torcherino accelerator torches no longer affect NTM machines
* RBMK control rod colors and auto control rod settings are now copiable
* Murky wings no longer have slowfall, and using shift+space cancels the momentum
* Murky wings are now slow by default and speed up when sprinting
* The arc furnace can now be used with AE2 buses, which was previously not possible due to the unique stacksize limitations

## Fixed
* Fixed conveyor grabber dropping items off at an offset when placing them on a conveyor belt due to a client desync
* Fixed occasional crash caused by using the settings tool on the autoloader
* Fixed QMAW not correctly working with other languages
* Fixed QMAW loading breaking entirely due to file encoding
* Fixed PWR fuel rod textures being 18x18 instead of 16x16
