## Changed
* The amount of filled rebar that can be rendered at once is now capped (can be changed with the client config `RENDER_REBAR_LIMIT`)
  * This causes holes and looks a bit buggy, but for now it's better than lagging the game out
* The amount of light beams per solar boiler is now limited (can be changed with the client config `RENDER_HELIOSTAT_BEAM_LIMIT`)
* Changed the way mirror linking works for the solar boiler
  * The max range is now 100m (instead of 25m)
  * There is now an angle requirement, mirrors cannot be rotated more than 45Â°
  * This means that the solar boiler can use more mirrors, the higher up it is
  * Existing setups will continue to function, as these rules only apply during the linking process
* The PWR and watz now have NEI handlers, showing the fuel to depleted fuel process

## Fixed
* Fixed broken localization in the recipe selector GUI
* Fixed the server crashing instantly
  * I lost track of how many times this has been an issue
