## Added
* `/ntmserver`
  * Functions like `/ntmclient` but for common settings
  * Can toggle `DAMAGE_COMPATIBILITY_MODE`, off by default, enables a more compatible (but slightly jankier) version of the bullet damage code
  * `MINE_<xxx>_DAMAGE` can be used to adjust landmine damage

## Changed
* Fat mines now use the standardized mini nuke code
  * Fat mines now have a base damage of exactly 100, being identical to demolition mini nukes
  * Fat mines now gib affected entities
* IV bags now use `setHealth` operations instead of dealing damage, preventing health duplication by just avoiding the damage

## Fixed
* Fixed animation error on the MAS-36
