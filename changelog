## Changed
* Increased bayonet damage from 5 to 7.5 hearts
* Two numeric redstone over radio signals sent over the same channel will now be added together instead of one signal replacing the other
  * This means that reading the fill state of multiple batteries over the same channel should result the combined fill state of all batteries
* Halved base spread of the .22 SMG
* Certain secret guns now have a proper way of being obtained
* Demolition mini nukes now create fire again
* New server configs
  * `CRATE_OPEN_HELD` can toggle whether crates can be opened when held
  * `CRATE_KEEP_CONTENTS` can toggle whether crates keep their contents when broken
  * `ITEM_HAZARD_DROP_TICKRATE` can change the time between ticks for dropped item hazard checks (gunpowder, lithium), default is 2, lowest is 1
* Duds now have multiple variants
  * Dismantling different variants yields different drops
  * Magnetic extraction can no longer be performed
* `isItemBlacklisted` on the item hazard checks now employs caching instead of doing a full ore dictionary lookup for every single check, this should make it marginally more performant
* The unfinished trains stuff is no longer listed in the creative tabs

## Fixed
* Fixed RoR controller having the wrong recipe
* Either fixed the crate dupe/voiding issues or made them even worse
* Fixed skeletons and pedestals allowing blocks to be placed inside the player
* Fixed artillery shells not playing the explosion animation when directly impacting entities
* Fixed bauxite and malachite vein toggles being on backwards
* Fixed pneumatic tube order settings not saving
* Fixed crash caused by launching ABMs with blank target designators
* Fixed particle source throwing errors when trying to save nonexistant particles
