## Changed
* Increased bayonet damage from 5 to 7.5 hearts
* Two numeric redstone over radio signals sent over the same channel will now be added together instead of one signal replacing the other
  * This means that reading the fill state of multiple batteries over the same channel should result the combined fill state of all batteries

## Fixed
* Fixed RoR controller having the wrong recipe
