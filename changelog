## Changed
* Updated russian and chinese localization
* VNT type explosions now track affected block positions when the explosion events fire, this should ensure compatibility with mods that rely on that
  * For example, this should make ForgeCreeperHeal work with most of NTM's explosions
* Obliterated standard fluid IDs
  * The multi ID is now a lot cheaper
  * For convenience in the creative tab, fluid IDs are now listed with all fluids pre-defined, just like how the old IDs were available
  * The multi ID now changes metadata based on the selected fluid type, allowing it to be usable for crafting pre-defined pipes
* The multi ID fluid selector now displays fluid traits in addition to the name when hovering over an icon
* Added more values to the data table returned by RBMK consoles via OC integration
* The conveyor ejector now has a "only take maximum possible" toggle
  * Enabling this means that, if stack ejection upgrades are installed, only stacks that meet the limit can be ejected
  * Items with a lower maximum stacksize will be ejected regardless

## Fixed
* Fixed the T-51b set not having radiation resistance
* Potentially fixed a crash on thermos-derived servers involving the flow control pumps
* Fixed crash caused when another tile entity replaces an RBMK component due to an unchecked cast
* Fixed constant cascading chunk gen caused by meteorites and flower patches
* Fixed garbage loot pool sometimes producing "stone wires"
