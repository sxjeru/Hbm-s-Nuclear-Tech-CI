## Added
* PWR
  * The successor to the old large nuclear reactor
  * Has some design similarities with the RBMK, but in 3D
  * Relatively easy to build and safe to operate
  * Does not use any tile entity rendering and all math is pre-calculated when the reactor is assembled, making this one even more performant than the old large reactor
* Sodalite
  * A gem that can be extracted from fluorite or lapis ore
  * Can be heated in the combination oven to make sodium and chlorine
* Liquid sodium
  * Valid PWR coolant with high efficiency rating
  * Made by liquefacting sodium
* Liquid thorium salt
  * Valid PWR coolant
  * Has a high flux multiplication rate, boosting fuels
  * After cooling, the depleted salt has to be reprocessed using a chemical plant

## Changed
* Bedrock fluorite ore now yields actual ore instead of fluorite directly
* Blocks that fall from fallout effects no longer drop items when falling on small blocks, preventing issues like gas blocks being dropped
* Bullets no longer need primers to be crafted, primers no longer exist at all
* The automatic buzzsaw can now use wood oil, ethanol, fish oil and heavy oil to run
* Fluorite ore is now centrifugable
* Fluorite crystals now centrifuge into slightly less fluorite but also yield sodalite
* Blast resistance values for most resistant blocks have been changed, most blocks now have much lower resistance which means there's now a practical difference between concrete and ducrete. Resistance values also match the block's cost more closely.

## Fixed
* Fixed FEnSU's IO limit not working properly
* Fixed overflow caused by uncapped Spk values of DFC beams, they are now capped at 9,200,000 Spk
* Fixed smooth lighting not working on connected textures
* Fixed the Thermos preventer not working on Crucible type servers
* Fixed pollution save files not working correctly on certain Thermos forks
* Fixed blast furnace output overstacking
* Fixed potential crash caused by centrifuges trying to create a recipe using non-registered items
* Fixed chemplant GUI crashing when too many upgrades are applied to a short duration recipe
* Corium is now a finite fluid, fixing an issue where a single fuel rod can be used to create a giant blob of corium, lagging out the server
* Fixed bullets not being able to pass things like tall grass
* Whether the player has received a guide book is now saved as part of the extprop which might fix an issue where offline mode players get a new book on every start
