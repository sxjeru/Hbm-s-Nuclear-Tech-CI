## Added
* Electrolysis machine
  * A large machine that can do the chemical plant's electrolysis recipes, as well as crystal processing
  * Crystals are turned into molten metals as well as byproducts, the metal can be cast using foundry blocks
  * Processing crystals requires nitric acid and yields more than what the centrifuge would give
* Environment suit
  * An airtight suit for diving with high radiation resistance
  * Relatively cheap, but protection is comparatively low
  * Has sprint assist and accelerated diving

## Changed
* Bedrock ores now spawn in the nether
  * Nether bedrock ores include red phosphorus and glowstone, both yielding powders instead of ores
  * All current nether bedrock ores are tier 1 and do not require any bore fluid
* Custom machines now show their recipes in NEI
  * All it took was battling NEI's source code for 3 hours and my sanity
* The chlorocalcite centrifugation process now requires 8,000mB of sulfuric acid instead of 100mB of water
* Mixed chlorocalcite solution now requires flux as a reducing agent
* All chlorine producing electrolysis recipes have been moved to the electrolysis machine and can no longer be done in the chemical plant
  * If only there was a much simpler recipe that may have existed at some point, life could be a dream

## Fixed
* Fixed custom machines not sending fluid
* Fixed custom machine item IO not working beyond the first slot
* Fixed the player's arms clipping through the armor model when punching
