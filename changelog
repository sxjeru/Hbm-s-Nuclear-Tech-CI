## Changed
* Automatic crafting tables will no longer accept stacks with a stack size higher than 1 via automation, items will still accumulate and form stacks inside the crafting table, however inserters/hoppers may not transfer larger stacks in a single operation
  * This ensures that the items get spread out as intended instead of the inserter just placing the entire stack into one slot and then leaving the other slots empty

## Fixed
* Fixed crash caused by null entries in the furnace recipe list being picked up by the arc furnace
* Fixed crash caused by the automatic crafting table's input when pattern slots are empty
* Fixed crash caused by the automatic crafting table's output (pattern info was accessed OOB)
