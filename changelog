## Changed
* Large models no longer use display lists, instead their rendering makes use of the more modern VBO system
  * Models using VBOs should now render slightly faster
  * This also fixes an issue with Angelica where certain parts of the model would render transparently
* All pylons and electrical connectors are now dyeable, using any dye (even modded ones, based on ore dict) to change the color of the cable
  * Colors are based on the connecting pylon, not the cables themselves, meaning that using one dye will change all wires connected to that pylon right up to the half way point
* Glyphid behemoths now spew sulfuric acid instead of hydrogen peroxide
* Glyphid brawlers can now leap at nearby players
* The structure config has changed
  * Instead of a central toggle for enabling/disabling structures, there's now three possible settings, enabling structures, disabling structures or making structure spawn respect the setting from the world creation menu
* Pressurized gauges like for the vacuum refinery and hydrotreater no longer have slots for item barrels (as those would logically not work), instead they show a pressure symbol
* Auditory geiger counters in armors will now click based on the radiation level *inside* the suit, i.e. the effective exposure for the player
* Diamonds are now a valid crucible material, turning into carbon at a 1:1 ratio (like graphite)
* Emerald is also a valid crucible material now, turning into beryllium at a 4:3 ratio
* Emeralds can now be mined as bedrock ores with a weight of 50 (half as common as iron, as common as redstone)
* Tritium lamps are now substantially cheaper
* Glyphid scouts can now spawn during the day when rampant glyphid spawning is enabled (artificial light however will still prevent them from spawning, keeping them out of bases)
* Balefire now has a much higher ignition radius
* Balefire becomes darker the more it spreads, making it possible to gauge how much further or if at all the balefire will spread
* The comparator output range of the pile fuel rods has been adjusted, allowing rods to be ejected exactly when they turn into bred uranium rods

## Fixed
* Fixed rocket artillery turret not saving loaded ammo type/count
* Fixed crash caused by custom missile launchers operating without designator
* Fixed meltdown elementals rendering their beam in the NEI spawner screen, causing extreme lag or the game to freeze
* Fixed certain incompatibilities with Angelica, like machine models being transparent and connected texture blocks not rendering at all
* (Hopefully) fixed the issue of balefire spreading forever for good
* Fixed stirling engines not outputting into cables
* Power buffers (i.e. things that act as both providers and receivers in the same network) now have the lowest sending priority (sending priority didn't exist until now), preventing them from wasting transfer capacity by ping-ponging before all other relevant parts of the network are done transferring
* Fixed potential issue causing diodes to consume negative energy
