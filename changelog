## Changed
* Changed the multi fluid ID recipe, they now use analog circuits instead of silicon based ones, no longer requiring plastic to make
* Decreased the connection speed for all battery blocks, a full discharge now takes 30 seconds instead of 1 second, and charging now takes 10 seconds
  * Capacitors have also been nerfed but they are twice as fast as battery blocks, 5 seconds for charging and 15 seconds for discharging
* Removed forgotten bricks
* Updated CMB brick texture
* The ICF machine block now renders with its 3d model in the creative inventory
* "Toggle backpack" keybind is now called "toggle jetpack" to reduce confusion

## Fixed
* Fixed pumpjack gauges not syncing properly
* Fixed some concrete variants not being revertable into uncolored concrete
* Fixed the ore density scanner not using proper translations for the HUD
* Fixed the solar boiler's rays rendering on fast graphics instead of on fancy graphics
* Fixed hydroreactive items not exploding when submerged in water
* Fixed fluid valves visually disconnecting when switching state
* Fixed fluid valves no visually connecting when type is set
* Fixed falling blocks spawned by nukes or impulse grenades dropping blocks that don't have drops
* Added even more exception handling to CompStacks, hopefully fixing an incompatibility with Mana Metal
