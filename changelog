* Updated boxducts
  * All boxducts are now way cleaner, only having bolts on intersections, with straight parts only having very light seams
  * Intersections now have unique textures for each size
  * Copper boxducts now have a much nicer color gradient
  * Exhaust pipes now have a more rusted appearance
