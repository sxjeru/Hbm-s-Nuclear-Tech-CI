## Added
* New meteorite ores
  * All previous meteorite ores have been removed (each took up an entire block ID...) which have been replaced with a single block that uses metadata
  * There's now only five variants with the contents chosen to be especially useful in earlygame: iron, copper, aluminium, rare earth and cobalt
  * Each ore smelts into 16 items, except for cobalt which yields only 4 ingots
  * All meteorite ores are now equally likely to spawn
  * The new ores can only be smelted, shredding or other processing is not possible

## Changed
* The Souyz' recipe is now available in the standard template folder
* Removed some unused crap
  * UV lamps (2 IDs)
  * AMS (9 IDs)
  * Rotary engine (1 ID)
  * FWatz (8 IDs)
  * Meteorite ores (10 IDs)
  * Tiny nuclear rector (1 ID)
* The small oil heaters are no longer craftable and the NEI handler has been removed, however existing ones can still be used
* The loot pool for meteorite treasure blocks has been updated
  * Treasures are no longer senselessly progression breaking, radioactive or plain stupid (whole-ass machines inside meteorites)
  * The treasure now consists of mainly some rarer earlygame ingots, circuits, some gear, a small selection of armor mods and alexandrite (rare)
* Schraranium processing now yields neptunium as a byproduct instead of plutonium, making neptunium easier to automate outside of the cyclotron
* Using the guide book now opens a link to the new wiki
* Certain earlygame things can now be recycled like stirling engines and gears
* Antenna part recycling has been moved to the anvil
* NTM's pickaxes now have a break speed bonus for glass
* renamed the foundry slag outlet to foundry spill outlet because people always assume it's for slag and only slag (it is not)
* The description for heatable/coolable fluid tags is now written in the same line as the label

## Fixed
* Fixed DFC receivers not outputting power
* Fixed the custom machine NEI handlers not working
* Fixed a potential crash caused by invalid assembly templates
* Fixed general weirdness with the schrabidium transmutator item IO
* Fixed certain tooltips using the backslash escape character despite not needing them
* Hopefully fixed the immense lag caused by tom post impact mechanics, burning grass will now only spread 20% of the time (instead of 100) and the world destruction handler will only process half the blocks per chunk
* Hopefully fixed an issue where substations would not reliably connect to cable blocks
