## Changed
* QMAW now has buttons for returning to previously viewed pages
* QMAW file detection now includes subfolders to `manual` in folder-based packs (which already worked in zip packs and the mod's jar file)
* OpenComputers integration for the ZIRNOX should now return values in Â°C and bar instead of unexplained weird internal units
* The sodium and strontium autogen ingots now have their correct hazard tags
* Pattern matchers, like the one used on the automatic crafting table, no longer care about NBT data of an item
  * This means that RBMK fuel rods can now be automatically disassembled without the depletion number having to be a 100% match
  * Due to the way the RBMK uncrafting handler works, a single autocrafter now correctly supports RBMK fuel of one type of any depletion level, yielding the correct recycling pellets
* Blueprint folders have been added to more loot pools, making them less rare
* Replaced the winnie the pooh plushie with hundun
* Retextured the universal fluid tanks and barrels again
* Updated steel trapdoor texture
* Removed the old hexafluoride tanks from the creative tab

## Fixed
* Fixed QMAW not working at all
* Potentially fixed a bug where proxy tile entities would reference unloaded core tile entities which would cause bizarre item voiding/duping issues in rare cases
* Fixed fusion reactor automation being able to remove items other than the breeding output slot
* Fixed chunkloading transport drones getting stuck due to off-by-one rounding errors
* Fixed shift-click handling on the electric arc furnace not working with upgrades, and putting electrodes in the wrong slot
* Fixed issue with the load order where custom fluids wouldn't work properly for fluid loading/unloading and in custom recipes
* Fixed balefire bomb not rendering the egg when fully loaded
* Fixed selenium steel 12ga casings having the wrong color
* Fixed the buzzsaw sometimes not replanting crops
* Scrungus
