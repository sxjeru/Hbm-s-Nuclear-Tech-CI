## Added
* Powered drill
  * Gasoline-fueled mining drill with AoE
  * Uses the gun system and therefore does not have configurable abilities
  * Mining level of iron tools by default
  * AoE, melee damage, reach and mining level can be upgraded with drill bits
  * Mining speed and fuel used can be changed with engines (diesel, aviation, electric, turbo)
  * Fortune can be added as mods (both mods do in fact stack, yielding fortune III)
  * Not a precision tool, intended to be used alongside pickaxes instead of replacing them
  * Despite this, sneaking allows the AoE to be disabled
  * Unlike pickaxes, shows a preview for what area is to be mined
  * Due to not being considered a tool like a vanilla one, it's not affected by dig speed penalties from fatigue, being underwater or on a ladder

## Changed
* Updated russian and chinese localization
* VNT type explosions now track affected block positions when the explosion events fire, this should ensure compatibility with mods that rely on that
  * For example, this should make ForgeCreeperHeal work with most of NTM's explosions
* Obliterated standard fluid IDs
  * The multi ID is now a lot cheaper
  * For convenience in the creative tab, fluid IDs are now listed with all fluids pre-defined, just like how the old IDs were available
  * The multi ID now changes metadata based on the selected fluid type, allowing it to be usable for crafting pre-defined pipes
* The multi ID fluid selector now displays fluid traits in addition to the name when hovering over an icon
* Added more values to the data table returned by RBMK consoles via OC integration
* The conveyor ejector now has a "only take maximum possible" toggle
  * Enabling this means that, if stack ejection upgrades are installed, only stacks that meet the limit can be ejected
  * Items with a lower maximum stacksize will be ejected regardless
* Survey scanners now pick up bedrock oil
* The conveyor sorter filter slots now have directional labels instead of only color coding
  * Apparently color blind people exist?
* Conveyor sorters can now process boxes
  * All stacks are sorted individually, and each batch of items that comes out of one side is sent as a box
* Conveyor boxers can now accept boxes, this is useful for batching up partial boxes that come out of sorters
* Conveyor inserters can now accept boxes directly instead of causing them to burst open
* Conveyor inserters now have a special rule when supplying an arc furnace where instead of trying a full stack and then one item, the first always failing and the last being too slow, they will supply the slot target amount instead
  * Given the cycle delay and the lid's movement speed, the inserters should now be fast enough to fully supply a speed III arc furnace
* Skeletons can now be gibbed by explosions, although it will spawn clean bone particles and omit the gore splash effect
* Polymer power tools now only have AoE 1 instead of AoE 2
* The fluid container NEI handler now also includes the empty container, making it easier to find what fluids a canister for example is usable for
* Changed Mk2 infinite water barrel to use generic cast parts instead of a very specific type of pipe
* Retextured the multi fluid IDs to look more like the old IDs they replaced
* Logistics provider and requester crates can now only connect to a path node if that path is a dedicated waypoint
  * This means that requesters and providers will no longer connect automatically, a logistics net now requires at least one dedicated waypoint
  * This also means that in larger networks with many providers and requesters, all the useless connections between them which scale exponentially will no longer exist
  * This is a band-aid fix for logistics nets destroying the game even at lower scales due to the path finding being unperformant as hell
  * The system will have to be reworked entirely sooner or later (ough)
* PWR parts have been moved fro mthe workbench to the assembler
* Rebalanced a lot of expensive mode recipes
  * Some oil proc machines are now a tad cheaper
  * Extensive boards now use four rubber bars instead of gold wires
  * The CCGT is now considerably cheaper, using similar materials as a turbofan
  * Fusion reactors now use welded tc/cd alloy again
  * 256k tanks now use half as much steel
  * Gerald is now way more expensive
  * PWR parts are now subject to expensive mode

## Fixed
* Fixed the T-51b set not having radiation resistance
* Potentially fixed a crash on thermos-derived servers involving the flow control pumps
* Fixed crash caused when another tile entity replaces an RBMK component due to an unchecked cast
* Fixed constant cascading chunk gen caused by meteorites and flower patches
* Fixed garbage loot pool sometimes producing "stone wires"
* Fixed mining lasers targeting blocks with the "gas" material
* Fixed gun looping sounds behaving weird when moving while firing
* Fixed an issue where weapon mods with the highest stat change priority would break the mod sorting, leading to inconsistent behavior
