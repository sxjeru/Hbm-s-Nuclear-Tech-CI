## Added
* Arc furnace
  * A large version of the arc furnace that can do several types of recipe
  * Solid mode smelts items like a furnace, however to work the recipe needs an ingredient or result that is oredicted as either an ore, block, ingot or plate
  * Liquid mode smelts items like a crucible would, effectively liquiefying metals. Non-castable materials are voided
  * Both modes have arc furnace exclusive recipes (smelting sand/quartz/fiberglass into silicon)
  * Can be upgraded only with regular speed upgrades
* Soldering station
  * Works similar to arc welders
  * Used to assemble circuits from parts
* New circuits
  * The old circuits will be phased out, the items remain but can be recycled
  * Circuits use an entirely new approach for crafting, instead of upgrading tiers constantly, all circuits are made from common parts
  * Circuits can be automated entirely with only autocrafters, presses and the soldering station, no assembler or chemplant required
  * Legacy circuits can be recycled in any anvil, yielding the roughly equivalent new circuit

## Changed
* Updated russian and italian localization
* Nerfed conventional explosives (dynamite, TNT, semtex, C4) in order to not outclass small nukes
* Plastic explosive blocks no longer drop and blocks
* Sellafite diamond ore now shreds into diamond gravel
* ICF vessel blocks now use half as much fullerite as before
* ICF capacitor and turbocharger blocks are now quite a bit cheaper
* MEP is no longer self-igniting
* The foundry storage basin now holds 4 blocks worth of material instead of 1
* The small arc furnace is being retired and is no longer craftable. However, it will still function, and it can use any type of electrode without depleting it
* Wires now use the autogen system and are oredicted with the "wireFine" prefix (equivalent to GT fine wires, 1/8 of an ingot)
* Removed the assembler recipes for wires
* Increased the maximum durability for all stamps
* All upgrades now use the soldering station for their recipes, except for overdrive
* Overdrive upgrade recipes have been rebalanced

## Fixed
* Fixed missing localization for meteorite ores and the new crucible materials
* Removed the starmetal crystallization recipe, despite starmetal ore no longer existing
* Fixed the ICF structure block detection being incorrect, omitting some parts
* Fixed armor mods adding health showing only half as much as they actually do
* Fixed RBMK fuel xenon burn function being described wrong
* When converting ComparableStacks to ItemStacks, there is now a check that replaces null items with the nothing placeholder, fixing crashes caused by incorrect recipe configuration
* Fixed item icon lighting in the anvil's search field
* Fixed custom machine NEI handlers (again)
* Fixed FEL making sounds when turned on but not actually active
