## Changed
* VNT type explosions now track affected block positions when the explosion events fire, this should ensure compatibility with mods that rely on that
  * For example, this should make ForgeCreeperHeal work with most of NTM's explosions

## Fixed
* Fixed the T-51b set not having radiation resistance
* Potentially fixed a crash on thermos -derived servers involving the flow control pumps
