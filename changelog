## Added
* More custom machine parts
  * Custom machines now have a neutron acceptor which allows them to use flux from the breeding reactor in recipes
  * There is now a heat acceptor which can accept heat from things like fireboxes or electric heaters
  * Also added a config option to create pollution
* Hydrotreater
  * Tier 3 oil machine (on the same level as vacuum oil and reforming)
  * Can de-sulfurize oil, which allows extraction of sour gas directly from crude oil
  * Using desulfurized oil skips the (rather destructive) desulfurization process of the standard refinery, yielding higher-quality oils
  * Hydrotreating also allows cracked diesel variants to turn into their normal counterparts
  * Can convert coal oil directly into coal gasoline

## Changed
* Deco bocks now drop all of the time, but they drop themselves instead of ingots
  * To get the ingots, deco blocks now have to be deconstructed in the anvil, yielding an ingot 25% of the time
  * If I see one more person complaining about the chances I'm reducing it down to 10%
* Catalytic reformers now have a tooltip informing about the need for a catalytic converter
* Several guns now have reload animations including most .357 revolvers and Samuel
* Updated stealth missile texture
* Some of the larger oil machines now render using display lists which should make them somewhat more performant
* Glyphid diggers can no longer yeet multiblocks or blocks with tile entity
* Parasite-infested glyphids now explode into gore when the parasites pop out
* Missiles now have a top acceleration twice as much as the previous acceleration, but instead of being static, the acceleration goes up from 0 to max within 3 seconds
  * This makes missiles reach top speed faster while also making the launches themselves slower and more pleasant
* Strange stone can no longer be destroyed via AoE, making it easier to find without accidentally mining it
* Launch pads now spawn launch smoke just like custom missile compact launchers
* Remodeled all tier 0 missiles
* Tier 0 missiles now have a much thinner contrail to match their size better
* Covneyor ejectors can now eject sulfur out of the side ports of refineries
* Refineries and vacuum refineries now have fluid ID slots for changing the recipe
* Removed the remaining old oil separation recipes from the chemical plant
* More large models have been converted into display lists which should improve performance somewhat
* Corroded barrels now crumble after a while
* PWRs on the edge of unloaded chunks now additionally reset their internal heat value to further reduce the time until they can potentially melt down
* Removed the assembly recipe for the radial engine since it will be retired soon

## Fixed
* Fixed dupe caused by shift-clicking ashes out of the bricked furnace
* Fixed missiles jerkingly rotating when launching, they should now smoothly transition from being part of the launch pad to being an entity
* Fixed missile control and launch smoke shifting around when the player is moving
* Fixed fast-moving missiles spawning too few particles, causing holes in the contrail
* Fixed coker units creating soot when not processing anything
* Foundry molds can no longer be removed from basins when there's still material in them, fixing a bug where doing so would void the material
* Fixed molds not saving when cooling off, allowing to dupe metal when leaving and rejoining
* Fixed normal drones loading chunks
* Fixed chunk-loading drones not loading chunks
* Fixed several chemistry templates missing names
* Fixed rampant mode random scout spawns being able to appear inside blocks
