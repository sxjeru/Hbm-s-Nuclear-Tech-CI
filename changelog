## Changed
* After three quarters of a decade, three separate models, countless rebalances and hours of senseless yapping, the industrial generator has finally met its end. Suddenly, yet not unsurprisingly, on this here day the industrial generator has closed its eyes for the final time. It was a long and eventful journey, but as with all things in life, it too had to come to an end.
  * And this is why we can't ever have anything nice

## Fixed
* WarTec should now be compatible again
