## Added
* T-51b power armor
  * Serves as a replacement for the T-45

## Changed
* Added more QMAW pages
* Removed most old particle accelerator blocks from the creative inventory
* All dual wielded guns now render more accurately when dropped instead of only showing one gun
* Added support for left handed guns (currently unused)*
* Removed the presentations for the old particle accelerator and schottky diode
* Gibbing NPCs now also spawns bones, if supported by the skeletonizer
  * Gibbed bones only have a 50% chance of spawning and come with a unique red texture
  * Gibbed bones have a way shorter lifetime and higher gravity to match the gib particles

## Fixed
* Fixed wood burner only being able to create one ash pile per item burned, even when that item yields more, creating a backlog in the internal ash value
* Fixed some QMAW link icons not having the correct block lighting applied
