## Added

## Changed
* Bedrock ores now spawn in the nether
  * Nether bedrock ores include red phosphorus and glowstone, both yielding powders instead of ores
  * All current nether bedrock ores are tier 1 and do not require any bore fluid
* Custom machines now show their recipes in NEI
  * All it took was battling NEI's source code for 3 hours and my sanity
