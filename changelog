  * Double base speed, but also double power draw
  * Three upgrade slots, upgrades follow the same rules as on the new chemplant

* Potentially fixed shift clicking issue with the new chemical plant
* Fixed blowtorch having a minimum gas requirement of 1,000mB despite only using 250mB
* The gas turbine now uses audio with a 20 tick timeout, fixing a rare issue where the loop gets stuck and never ends
