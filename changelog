## Changed
* Updated chinese localization
* Tweaked super shotgun animations, added config for changing the animation style
* The benelli now has reloading animations and the drum mag as advertised
* Tom will now explode close to bedrock even when not hitting a block
* The assembler recipe config now uses the same system as all other recipe configs, the file has moved into the `hbmRecipes` folder
  * Old files are still compatible if moved to the new folder, since the base structure of the recipe file is the same
  * Recipes should work as expected with the `/ntmreload` command
  * Recipes now have an optional list for specifying which template folder they are made in

## Fixed
* Fixed the structure toggle on the world creation screen not working correctly on most world types
