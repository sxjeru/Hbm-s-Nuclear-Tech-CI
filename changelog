## Changed
* All pylons and electrical connectors are now dyeable, using any dye (even modded ones, based on ore dict) to change the color of the cable
  * Colors are based on the connecting pylon, not the cables themselves, meaning that using one dye will change all wires connected to that pylon right up to the half way point
