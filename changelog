## Changed
* Any bullet that can ricochet (or at least runs the code for it) can now also break glass, as well as destroy red barrels
* Removed three old achievements which no longer work due to the gun changes
* AJR armor plating now uses niobium instead of saturnite, and yields twice as many items per recipe
* Due to the gating change, the saturnite anvil now has a tier equivalent to a bronze anvil
* Doubled the liberator's base damage to be on-par with the lever action shotgun in order to offset its poor performance due to the reload speed
* Decreased the explosive 12 gauge's damage from x5 to x2.5
* All non black powder shotgun shells now have some amount of damage threshold negation in order to not immediately become useless when used against early power armor
  * Obviously shot will always fare worse against higher tier armor, in those cases either use flechettes, slugs, any of the high tier rounds or a different caliber entirely
* Bombers and cargo planes now use interpolation, making their movement smoother and fixing potential desyncs due to TPS
* Trenchmaster armor no longer displays benefits that no longer exist
* Legendaries are no longer found in red rooms, rather they have a whole new system of being discovered and crafted
  * "Recipes" are still subject to change, but the base system is final
  * There will some day be a completely new dungeon for those, but for now I used what I had
  * Mayhaps a new legendary has appeared?
* Glyphids now make use of the same resistance system as armors, their armor is no longer completely ignored by the new guns
  * Different damage types have different resistances
  * Damage resistance remains the same, while damage threshold is determined by the glyphid's armor - breaking the armor off will decrease the damage threshold
  * Balancing might still be off, however glyhids shouldn't be too tanky
* I still haven't bothered to fix the bolter. It's like the son I don't love
* Changed some of the sounds of the guns that still used the default black powder noise
* The flamethrower turret now uses the new flamethrower projectiles
* The now unused old gun items have been completely obliterated
* Headhot mulitpliers now apply for most conventional projectiles, by default the bonus for headshots is +25% damage
  * JHP adds +50%

## Fixed
* Fixed 9mm soft points being called ".9mm"
* Fixed missing localization for the hard plastic and PVC autogen materials
* Fixed the fat mine's crafting recipe still using the deprecated ammo item
* Removed legacy ammo items and guns from all remaining item pools
* Fixed the rubber grip not having a recipe
* Fixed the coilgun and bolter not being classified correctly
* Fixed new death messages not working
* Fixed none of the armors having fall resistance
* Fixed survey scanners not picking up nether depth rock
* Fixed FMJ, AP and DU rounds not having damage threshold negation, making them worse against most armored targets compared to JHP
* Fixed autgen items made from unsmeltable materials being smeltable in the crucible
* Fixed 240mm shells not being visible in creative
* Fixed JHP's negative armor piercing value not being counted right, breaking the "armor is worth more" system
* Fixed the second UZI dealing more damage than it should
* Potentially fixed an issue where artillery rockets would sometimes get stuck mid-air
* Fixed the artillery rocket turret's grace range not being 250 as advertised
* Fixed black powder shotshells using smokeless powder instead of smokeful powder
* Fixed the ballistic gauntlet not working with the new system
  * Since base damage is now bound to weapons, the ballistic gauntlet now has a base damage of 15
