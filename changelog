## Added
* Nitra
  * Dropped by the painsaw ability when killing a mob
  * Can be used to quickly craft standard ammo types in the 2x2 crafting grid
  * Can also refill empty syringes, making stimpaks
* Latex
  * Made from crafting dandelions into dandelion milk, then smelting it
  * Replaces insulator in many recipes where electrical insulation that is potentially made from brick doesn't make sense, like rubber gas masks, jackets, tools and so on
  * Latex is interchangable with rubber in all recipes where it's used, but not the other way round
  * The old insulator is now mainly used for electrical and heat insulation as well as PWR rods

## Changed
* Light oil and cracked light oil can now be refomred into large quantities of aromatic hydrocarbons a well as some reformate gas
* The painsaw ability no longer drops ammo and syringes, instead it drops nitra

## Fixed
* Fixed thorium bedrock ore using the wrong ore dict key, making it unable to be processed via centrifuge or acidizer
* Fixed custom machine NEI slots going out of bounds after the third slot
* Fixed bismuth billets not being oredicted, making BFB PWR rods uncraftable
