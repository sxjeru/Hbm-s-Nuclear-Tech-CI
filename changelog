## Added
* More custom machine parts
  * Custom machines now have a neutron acceptor which allows them to use flux from the breeding reactor in recipes
  * There is now a heat acceptor which can accept heat from things like fireboxes or electric heaters
  * Also added a config option to create pollution

## Changed
* Deco bocks now drop all of the time, but they drop themselves instead of ingots
  * To get the ingots, deco blocks now have to be deconstructed in the anvil, yielding an ingot 25% of the time
  * If I see one more person complaining about the chances I'm reducing it down to 10%
* Catalytic reformers now have a tooltip informing about the need for a catalytic converter
* Several guns now have reload animations including most .357 revolvers and Samuel
* Updated stealth missile texture
