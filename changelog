## Changed
* Updated russian and chinese localization
* The fine soot recipe in the pyrolysis oven now only needs 4 tar
* Overdrive upgrades now use hard plastic/fullerite instead of lithium crystals
* Machines now only send their sync packets once a second instead of once per tick if the values haven't changed, reducing network traffic by a considerable amount
* Tom's explosion no longer causes any block updates on the millions of blocks it deletes which hopefully fixes a majority of the lag caused by the crater
* Overdrive upgrades now increase power usage in pyrolysis ovens (equivalent to 2 speed upgrades per level)
* Due to the increased maximum demand with overdrives + speed upgrades, the energy buffer for the pyrolysis oven has been increased tenfold
* Updated basalt textures
* Scaffold blocks can now be placed horizontally
* Updated the shredder's textures
* The strand caster will now cast its remaining buffer after 10 seconds of inactivity, even if the buffer is not full enough for a batch of 9
* The soldering station now has a toggle for the "refuse to do recipes with no fluid if fluid is present" behavior
* Recipes using the ore dictionary "oreThorium232" are now also generated for "oreThorium"

## Fixed
* The conveyor grabber should no longer skip over items when used in long lines
* Fixed a potential crash regarding crucibles
* Fixed compatibility with EndlessIDs, biome changes should no longer crash the game
* Fixed GL state leak caused by fluid tanks, causing some tile entities to be rendered without face culling
* Fixed a bug where using too many PWR heatsinks would cause an overflow, making the heat capacity negative
* Fixed landmines generating into the floor on superflat worlds
* All NTM type explosions are no longer affected by difficulty setting, preventing them from dealing damage in peaceful mode
  * There are a few instances of vanilla explosions still being used, those will be phased out in the future
* Fixed tutorial presentations triggering when hitting F1 not just in the inventory but also when looking at the block in question
