## Changed
* Changed bedrock ore processing time in the electrolyzer to 60 ticks

## Fixed
* Fixed issue where the NEI universal handler can not correctly display more than 4 outputs (now supports up to 8, which should cover all possible electrolyzer cases too)
* Fixed the metal electrolysis duration variable not being part of the config
