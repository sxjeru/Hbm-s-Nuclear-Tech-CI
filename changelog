## Added
* Satellite radar relay
  * Can be linked to a death ray
  * Allows the death ray to be used with the radar's targeting system
* Combinator funnel
  * Has 9 input and 9 output slots
  * Will automatically do single ingredient 2x2 or 3x3 recipes like compressing ingots into blocks at up to 9 operations per tick
  * Input is strictly on the top and output on the bottom
  * The side acts as an output for the ingredients as a way to de-clog the funnel from leftover materials
* Stealth missile
  * A missile that is not picked up by radars, turrets or ABMs
  * Marginally more powerful than a tier 1 HE missile
  * Somewhat expensive, takes a full minute to make in the assembler

## Changed
* Updated russian localization
* Nerfed scrap and dust even further
* Tiny dusts now shred into the generic tiny dust instead of scrap
* Tiny dust now shreds into more tiny dust, just like dust shreds into dust
* Updated the strange stone's texture to be more blatant about what it is
* Added more OC compat for the RBMK console
* Inverted large door's redstone behavior to be in line with vanilla iron doors
* The FEL now has a humming sound when it is active
* Updated the gadget's model
  * The wires will not render on the fast graphic setting for performance reasons
* Remade Lil'Pipsqueak
  * Now features proper animations for drawing the weapon, firing and reloading, as well as new sounds
  * Comes with a new and improved 3D model as well as a cylinder gap flash when firing
  * Is now part of the red room loot pool
  * Durability has been drastically increased (31k instead of 4k)
  * The boxcar now has new impact sounds and spawns fewer particles
* Powder box recipes now produce 8 boxes from the same amount of ingredients, making cyclotron recipes more affordable
* Buffed the radiation-powered engine, all valid fuels now produce 10x more energy per tick
* Removed tungsten and HSS bolts as dedicated items, they are now a single bolt item that uses the autogen system
  * Regular steel is now also a valid bolt material which will replace tungsten in many recipes where tungsten just doesn't make sense
  * Bolts Are now 1/8 of an ingot instead of 1/2 which makes some recipes marginally cheaper, as well as making them equal to GregTech bolts
  * Bolts are oredicted and interchangeable, as well as recycleable in the crucible
* The N45 naval mine has been obliterated
* The solar boiler's ray rendering is no longer bound by particle settings, instead it will be disabled when fast graphics are enabled
* The solar boiler's internal buffer has been reduced, its steam output is now capped at 10,000mB/t (which should be 20kHE/t or 0.8MHE/s)
* All crates except the jungle dungeon one now drop themselves when mined
  * Supply and conserve crates do not need a tool because they are made of wood, the ammo crate requires a pickaxe
  * All of those crates are now opened with the crowbar instead in order to be consistent with each other
* Standard gauge rails are now craftable and visible in the transportation tab
  * You can now play around with the new rail types in creative mode, as none of the train cars are currently craftable
  * Coupling should work, but coupling info is not saved to NBT so links will be lost when leaving the world
  * Trains might randomly derail on 5m curves, idk why

## Fixed
* Fixed afterburn upgrades not being craftable with bakelite
* Fixed bismuth block not being properly oredicted
* Powder detectors that are used in the same network as diodes should now be somewhat less wrong
* Fixed horrifying gamebreaking issue that would frequently cause crashes, corrupt worlds and bluescreen PCs where the red copper block and the advanced alloy block had inconsistent colors
* Fixed file cabinets not dropping their contents
* Fixed some sides of the pedestal not rendering
* Fixed particle accelerator window blocks not dropping when mined
