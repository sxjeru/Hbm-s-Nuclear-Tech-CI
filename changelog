## Added
* ICF pellet maker
  * Can create custom ICF fuel pellets
  * Pellets use binary fuels, meaning they need two different fluids, two different solids or a solid and a fluid
  * Optionally, the pellet maker can accept muon capsules, each capsule can add muons to up to 16 pellets, reducing the laser input requirement
  * Fuels currently only have default stats, custom stats will be added in the future

## Changed
* To make balancing easier, ICFs will only directly convert 25% of incoming laser heat into output heat when there is no fuel pellet loaded, meaning when using fuel, direct heating does not apply
* The ICF should now display its relevant values using Energy Control screens
* Sodium and calcium are now valid crucible materials
* All RBMK models that render as TESRs now use VBOs which should make them somewhat less laggy
* Blocks like explosive charges, radioactive barrels and so on which used to explode instantly when destroyed by another explosion, now behave more like TNT, spawning a primed version of the block that is knocked back by the initial explosion
  * This fixes an issue where spamming too many blocks like that could potentially crash servers
  * Most explosives go off after a short delay, flammable barrels however will explode on impact
* Removed unused permanent wings
* Added recipes to the ICF parts, the ICF can now be made in survival mode (recipes are still subject to change)

## Fixed
* Fixed ICF laser parts being considered valid when bordering an otherwise invalid dependency block
* Fixed soyuz launcher NEI recipe showing the wrong amount of items
* Fixed infinite xp exploit by constantly smelting and cooling things like meteorite ingots
* Fixed centrifuge speed upgrade tooltip
* Fixed smokestacks not working with a lot of machines
* Fixed soot values being completely off for most machines
* Fixed glyphid scouts not spawning in the daylight in rampant mode
