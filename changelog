## Added
* Boxcables
  * Like boxducts, but for power

## Changed
* Updated meteors
  * Meteors will now punch through weak blocks like leaves instead of getting stuck on trees
  * Meteor impacts now have new visuals
  * Falling meteors will produce a sound instead of stealthily blowing people up
  * Fallen meteors will now be placed deeper into the actual crater instead of hovering awkwardly over the hole
* Addd QMAW pages for the particle accelerator parts along with a PA overview page and a simple step by step construction tutorial
* Increased the acidizer partitioner's input limit from 9 to 45 slots
* Ammo containers are now functional again
  * Each gun has a fixed "default ammo" that will be given
  * Grants ammo for up to three held guns, selected randomly
  * Ammo given does not respect caliber conversion mods
  * Amount of ammo given depends on the mag size and type of ammo
    * Most pistols and low capacity rifles will get two reloads worth of ammo
    * High capacity rifles will typically get only one magazine
    * Rocket launchers typically only get a small amount of rockets
    * The fat man only gets a single nuke
    * Certain legendaries do not give ammo at all, they are omitted when three randomly held guns are selected
* Ammo containers are now found in more itempools

## Fixed
* Fixed arc furnace only allowing electrodes to be inserted when the lid is down instead of up
* Fixed issue where the `amounts` tracker wasn't being used correctly when using a custom acidizer config, preventing the acidizer partitioner from working
* Fixed multi fluid ID search potentially not working on systems with a non-latin locale
* Fixed particle accelerator source working even if not cooled
