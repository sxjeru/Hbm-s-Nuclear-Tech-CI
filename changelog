## Added
* Satellite radar relay
  * Can be linked to a death ray
  * Allows the death ray to be used with the radar's targeting system
* Combinator funnel
  * Has 9 input and 9 output slots
  * Will automatically do single ingredient 2x2 or 3x3 recipes like compressing ingots into blocks at up to 9 operations per tick
  * Input is strictly on the top and output on the bottom
  * The side acts as an output for the ingredients as a way to de-clog the funnel from leftover materials

## Changed
* Updated russian localization
* Nerfed scrap and dust even further
* Tiny dusts now shred into the generic tiny dust instead of scrap
* Tiny dust now shreds into more tiny dust, just like dust shreds into dust
* Updated the strange stone's texture to be more blatant about what it is
* Added more OC compat for the RBMK console
* Inverted large door's redstone behavior to be in line with vanilla iron doors
* The FEL now has a humming sound when it is active
* Updated the gadget's model
  * The wires will not render on the fast graphic setting for performance reasons
* Remade Lil'Pipsqueak
  * Now features proper animations for drawing the weapon, firing and reloading, as well as new sounds
  * Comes with a new and improved 3D model as well as a cylinder gap flash when firing
  * Is now part of the red room loot pool
* Powder box recipes now produce 8 boxes from the same amount of ingredients, making cyclotron recipes more affordable
* Buffed the radiation-powered engine, all valid fuels now produce 10x more energy per tick
* Removed tungsten and HSS bolts as dedicated items, they are now a single bolt item that uses the autogen system
  * Regular steel is now also a valid bolt material which will replace tungsten in many recipes where tungsten just doesn't make sense
  * Bolts Are now 1/8 of an ingot instead of 1/2 which makes some recipes marginally cheaper, as well as making them equal to GregTech bolts
  * Bolts are oredicted and interchangeable, as well as recycleable in the crucible

## Fixed
* Fixed afterburn upgrades not being craftable with bakelite
* Fixed bismuth block not being properly oredicted
* Powder detectors that are used in the same network as diodes should now be somewhat less wrong
