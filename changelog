## Changed
* Fortune on a drillbit now affects the quality of mined bedrock ore, each level of fortune adds 10% of the value to the item
* The arc furnace now has a five slot input queue which accepts full stacks
  * This removes the need for weird, hacky, buggy special implementations for inserters to work at a reasonable speed
  * This also means that pneumatic tubes and other mods' automation systems can now insert into the arc furnace with little issue
  * Should the mode change and items in the input queue no longer be usable, they automatically become ejectable via automation
  * The input queue slots are always accessible, not just when the lid is open
* Removed all the NTM sand mix blocks and replaced them with a single block that uses metadata
* Removed all tiers of the deprecated PA power plugs except one, leaving the old PAs just barely operational

## Fixed
* Fixed a potential crash caused by inserters connected to multiblocks that don't have a core tile
