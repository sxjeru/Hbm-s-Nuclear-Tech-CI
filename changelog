## Added
* UAC pistol
  * Uses the .45 caliber
* Cryo cannon
  * Freezes entities
  * Can only deal damage to already frozen entities
  * Damage is proportional to max health, dealing more damage the stronger the mob is
* Template crate
  * A cheap 27 slot crate
  * Assemblers will insert their loaded template into the template crate after doing one operation with it
  * Assemblers will also pull templates from template crates if no template is currently loaded
  * This hopefully makes certain types of automation like AE2 easier as the template is therefore treated like a crafting ingredient that is returned afterwards
* More coilgun ammo
  * Ferrouranium ball that has higher damage, higher wear and breaks blocks with higher resistance
  * Rubber ball that deals immense knockback to entities and bounces around

## Changed
* Making LPG in the compressor now requires two compression steps
  * This fixes an issue where polymer is unobtainable in 528 mode since petroleum at 1PU not being obtainable
* Fire and cryo damage now bypasses glyphid's armor, being unaffected by the armor's damage reduction and not being able to break off armor either
* Fire now deals 4x more damage to glyphids
* Cryogenic fluids from the chemthrower no longer deal direct damage, instead freezing the target
  * Once the target is already frozen, it will deal damage and apply the same effects as it used to
* Decreased the damage caused by hot fluids in the chemical thrower, regular steam no longer instantly vaporizes nuclear creepers
* Decreased acid damage and armor damage for corrosive liquids in the chemical thrower
* Glyphid hives have been made half as common, delete your config for this change to take effect
* The assembler now uses more modern code that lets it take and insert items from all storage blocks and not just NTM crates
  * This new code also causes assemblers to only take as many items from containers as are actually required instead of sucking up as much as available whcih would cause clogs
* Assemblers and chemical plants now take the required items from containers instantly instead of only taking a single item per tick
* The universal projectile entity has been updated, it now uses a much better synchronization and interpolation method that prevents position desyncs after bouncing
  * This also fixes issues where bullets could not damage multiple entities within the same tick, if they could penetrate them
  * The old system also had issues with spectral bullets not damaging entities right behind walls, which has been fixed
* The coilgun now destroys solid blocks in its path
* Glyphids no longer use extended 128 block targeting unless soot pollution crosses a certain threshold (1 by default)

## Fixed
* Fixed issue where mk5 explosions would behave weirdly in their origin chunk, often blowing through bedrock and thick layers of concrete
* Fixed saturnite rifle disappearing in third person when scoping
* Fixed cables not visually connecting to assemblers
