## Changed
* Blast doors will now pulverize any block that gets in their way during closing
* The nuclear and RTG furnaces will be retired, their recipes have been removed but they remain operational for now

## Fixed
* Fixed the CCGT's steam output breaking as soon as the steam buffer runs full
* Fixed crash caused by mobs holding belt-fed guns
* Fixed boiler heat input being way too low due to operation order (diffusion was applied AFTER the input heat was capped)
