## Changed
* Updated chinese localization
* Tweaked super shotgun animations, added config for changing the animation style
* The benelli now has reloading animations and the drum mag as advertised
* Tom will now explode close to bedrock even when not hitting a block
* The assembler recipe config now uses the same system as all other recipe configs, the file has moved into the `hbmRecipes` folder
  * Old files are still compatible if moved to the new folder, since the base structure of the recipe file is the same
  * Recipes should work as expected with the `/ntmreload` command
  * Recipes now have an optional list for specifying which template folder they are made in
* Electrolyzing heavy water now has the same yields as regular water, I don't remember why this incsonsistency existed and there was probably a reason for it but I don't care
* Electrolyzing fluids now only takes 20 ticks instead of 60
  * Batch sizes for water and heavy water have been doubled, effectively increasing throughout 6x
  * The throughput for electrolysis on chemical plants has been halved (but heavy water still has the output buff, effectively remaining unchanged)
* Custom machines now have an optional localization field which allows translations to be added within the config

## Fixed
* Fixed the structure toggle on the world creation screen not working correctly on most world types
* Fixed antiknock having a broken sprite and localization
* Fixed crash caused by fallout affecting spotlight blocks, crashing the game
