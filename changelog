## Changed
* Changed PA power draw penalties from x5 to x10
* Particles will now crash instantly if the dipole has both penalties in effect (underspeed + undersized ring)
  * This means that undersized accelerators require appropriate tier coils, and overtiered accelerators (i.e. high coils for low velocities) need to meet the size requirement
  * Accelerators where both penalties take effect are usually tiny ones with single tier coils (usually the highest tier required) which are lame
* DNT nano suit helmets now require quantum circuits instead of bismuth ones
* Made particle capsules more expensive
  * Since invalid recipes no longer void containers, this shouldn't really be a huge deal
* Both quadrupoles and dipoles now have a power cap of 2.5MHE
* RFCs now use 250kHE per pass (instead of 100k)
* Heavy water extraction now has a NEI handler

## Fixed
* Fixed particle detector not consuming power
* Fixed empty capsules not being recoverable from the color coded slots on the particle source
* Fixed particle detector nor charging from batteries
