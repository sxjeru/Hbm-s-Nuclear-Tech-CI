## Changed
* Particle detectors now print an error for when the recipe could not be completed
* Night Vision Goggles toggles with armor HUD
* Removed "no ore dict data" line from tooltips with extended view enabled
* Added a client config called `GUN_ANIMATION_SPEED` which allows the speed of gun animations to be changed
  * Mostly for debugging, since it only applies to the bus animation system, things like smoke trails and muzzle flashes are unaffected

## Fixed
* Fixed items being annihilated when shift clicking them into the particle source
* Fixed packet optimization not allowing packets to be sent when the day night cycle is halted
* Fixed particle detectors not always using power when they should
* Fixed rotary furnace voiding low pressure steam when dealing with input numbers not divisible by 100
* Fixed state leak causing smoke from the right akimbo weapon to glow when the first one is fired
