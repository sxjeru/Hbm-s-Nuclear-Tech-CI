## Changed
* Updated russian localization
* Nerfed conventional explosives (dynamite, TNT, semtex, C4) in order to not outclass small nukes
* Plastic explosive blocks no longer drop and blocks
* Sellafite diamond ore now shreds into diamond gravel
* ICF vessel blocks now use half as much fullerite as before
* ICF capacitor and turbocharger blocks are now quite a bit cheaper
* Nerfed MEP, it only outputs 75% the heat it used to per outgoing flux and its self-ignition rate has been reduced from 20 flux to 2.5

## Fixed
* Fixed missing localization for meteorite ores and the new crucible materials
* Removed the starmetal crystallization recipe, despite starmetal ore no longer existing
* Fixed the ICF structure block detection being incorrect, omitting some parts
* Fixed armor mods adding health showing only half as much as they actually do
