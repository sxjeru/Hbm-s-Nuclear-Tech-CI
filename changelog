## Added
* Limestone dust
  * Limestone now shreds into limestone dust instead of calcium (yields 4)
  * Can be combination cooked into calcium
  * Used for making cement
* Cement
  * Used in all concretes (only requires 1 per 16 concrete)
  * Either made from combining 1 limestone dust with 3 clay (yields 4) or from shredding slag (also yields 4)
* Bedrock ore processor
  * Used for separating the new bedrock ore
  * Creates ore slop as a byproduct
  * Slop can be coked into some rare byproducts or solidified into tar sand
  * Vitriol can be coked into iron and sulfuric acid or electrolyzed into sulfuric acid and chlorine
* New bedrock ore processing
  * Most bedrock ores now create a single common item that contains different quantities of the 6 main ore types
  * Ores can be processed in many different ways with three tiers of byproducts and many optional steps, also making use of machines that the old bedrock ores didn't
  * New bedrock ores are now rarer, only spawning in every 10th chunk vs in evbery 3rd
  * The old system can be restored via config

## Changed
* Updated italian localization
* Updated boxducts
  * All boxducts are now way cleaner, only having bolts on intersections, with straight parts only having very light seams
  * Intersections now have unique textures for each size
  * Copper boxducts now have a much nicer color gradient
  * Exhaust pipes now have a more rusted appearance
* Added an alternate recipe for blank upgrades using integrated circuits and polymer instead of analog circuits
* Update the soyuz and orbital module recipes
  * Simplified the recipes, fewer microcrafting parts
  * Both now use low-density elements which are made from aluminium/titanium, fiberglass and hard plastic
  * Both now make use of more advanced electronics, although in smaller numbers
* Removed the recipes for the satellite deco blocks, those will be phased out soon. Existing deco blocks can still be crafted back into functional satellites
* Moved the satellite recipes to the welder, the attachment is now welded onto the common satellite body
* Simplified the satellite recipes, adjusted cost based on utility (depth scanner, death ray and resonator are more expensive than the mapper/radar)
* CTRL + ALT view now shows the item's internal name and domain
* Adjusted Mekanism compat
  * Decreased crafting complexity and time for the digiminer assembler recipe
  * Replaced recipes for the wind turbine and atomic disassembler
  * Added a config option for toggling Mekanism compat
* Added recipe caching to the combinator funnel, meaning it no longer has to iterate over the entire recipe list all the time for compression/automation, this should improve performance by a fair bit
* Diodes now use silicon nuggets instead of nether quartz
* Aluminium wire's coloring is now consistent with the ingot
* Nuclear explosions below a radius of 75 no longer have a gamma flash, therefore a high yield mini nuke should no longer be able to instakill someone wearing full euph armor
* Updated OpenComputers compat
* The solar boiler now has a tooltip showing its contents
* Updated drones
  * Drones will now drop when destroyed
  * Drones are now generally faster (standard drones are now as fast as express drones used to be)
  * Holding a transport drone item now shows transport drone paths, just like how logistics drones work
  * Drones should no longer randomly get stuck on waypoints
  * Drones will now move upwards to avoid small ledges, this usually happens when drones approach docks from a lower angle
  * Logistics drone crates can now be disabled with a redstone signal
  * Logistics drone docks are now 5x faster, spawning a new rone every second instead of every 5 seconds
  * Drones are now a fair bit cheaper
* Tar sand can now be liquefacted into bitumen directly with a higher yield than the chemplant recipe
  * This however is slower, more energy intensive and yields no sand byproduct

## Fixed
* Fixed crash caused by PRISM updating unloaded worlds
* Hopefully fixed another crash caused by PRISM (reproduction was unreliable and sporadic, not confirmed)
