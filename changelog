## Added

## Changed
* Updated russian localization
* The UAC pistol's UV now looks prettier
* The UAC pistol now fires a burst on right click
* CCGTs can no longer have smoke removed from them, on the count of there not being enough connections anyway. The pollution rate is now equivalent to three small furnaces

## Fixed
* Fixed the bomber not spawning if the chunkloading radios is too small
* Fixed a couple spelling mistakes like BFB fuel being called ZFB and the broken ZIRNOX
* Potentially fixed a compat issue where galacticraft moon soil isn't shreddable into NTM moon turf
* Hopefully fixed the disappearing fluid buf once and for all
