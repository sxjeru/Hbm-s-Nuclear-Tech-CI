## Changed
* The fluid burner, heat exchanging heater and cooling tower now use the single steel pipe items instead of the larger steel pipes
* Reduced the amount of condensers needed for crafting the cooling towers
* Liquefactors and solidifiers now have a base processing time of 5 seconds per operation (instead of 10)
* Added some info to the coltass about how the coltan deposit works
* Moced some NEI handlers around, fluid containers are now listed last and radiolysis is now listed right after cracking, since they have the same recipes
* The autocrafter's inputs are now limited to 4 items per slot
* Autocrafters can now receive stacked items again (except for items with containers), if they do not exceed the 4 item threshold

## Fixed

* Fixed ICFs not forming correctly depending on the orientation
* Fixed electrolyzer metal recipe config not working
* Fixed the meteor charms not working when used on helmets
* Fixed NEI handler for the ICF's consturction showing inconsistent values
