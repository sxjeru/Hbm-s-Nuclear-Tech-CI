## Added
* Bismuth bronze and arsenic bronze
  * Kind of self-explanatory
  * Can be made into anvils, allows for an alternative that doesn't involve 10 entire ingots of bismuth for a single anvil

## Changed
* Arsenic is now made from only 16 oils scrap (instead of 256) in an ore acidizer using high-performance solvent (instead of chemical plant using sulfuric acid)
* Meteorite and starmetal anvils have been replaced with desh and saturnite ones

## Fixed
* Limited assembler input to up to 10 attempts per ingredient, fixing a rare issue where the assembler freezes the server when pulling items
* Fixed fallout effects not loading chunks
* Fixed RBMK steam channel recycling recipe
