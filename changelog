## Changed
* Updated russian localization
* The powder combination recipe for steel powder now yields steel scraps instead, meaning that it has to be smelted either via crucible or arc furnace
  * In addition, there is now an alternate recipe combining four times the material, yielding larger steel scraps, allowing for higher throughput
  * The recipes for magnetized tungsten and technetium steel also now output scraps, although they lack the quadruple yield recipes
  * Red copper got its powder mixing recipe back, also yielding scraps instead of powder
* The new autogen wire items now use texture overrides, restoring the original textures
* Arc furnaces now start burning on the inside as the electrodes are inserted, making the process look a lot more violent
* Arc furnaces in liquid mode will now immediately start draining their contents as soon as the lid starts lifting, instead of waiting until the lid is fully lifted
* The arc furnace's lid now moves faster depending on the upgrade (each upgrade adds 50% movement speed). Do note that this shortens the timespan for cycling items, so to utilize it fully you will need multiple or upgraded conveyors.
* Doubled the arc furnace's pouring speed to a full ingot per tick
* Demand for hard plastic per versatile circuit has been reduced from 4 to 2 bars per board
* The autocrafter now uses vacuum tubes instead of microchips
* Buoyant items (fish spawned by fishing dynamite) now sink in flowing water (i.e. in a tank of non-source blocks)
* Retextured all explosive sticks
* Added an extra digit to the CCGT's power gauge, allowing it to have even higher outputs
  * Doubled the reformate gas consumption rate
* Asbestos and flint are now arc smeltable, having the same silicon yields as fiberglass
* The quartz glass recipe has been moved to the arc furnace
* Borax can now also be smelted in the arc furnace, yielding the same 33% boron that the ore acidizer does
* Silicon boules can now be mixed with liquid oxygen in an acidizer to make nether quartz
* Silicon shards from bedrock ore processing now yield 3 silicon nuggets instead of nether quartz
* The soldering station should now have a working recipe config instead of just generating an empty template file
* Removed the old stinger rocket recipe

## Fixed
* Removed sand to silicon AE2 compat recipe which caused sand to be shreddable into the new silicon wafers, skipping the arc furnace entirely
* Fixed shift clicking into the arc furnace placing the entire stack into a single slot, ignoring stacksize limitations
