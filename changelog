## Added
* `/ntmserver`
  * Functions like `/ntmclient` but for common settings
  * Can toggle `DAMAGE_COMPATIBILITY_MODE`, off by default, enables a more compatible (but slightly jankier) version of the bullet damage code
  * `MINE_<xxx>_DAMAGE` can be used to adjust landmine damage
  * `TAINT_TRAILS` now replaces the hardcore taint config option, making taint blocks more potent and the potion effect trail taint blocks
* New ammo types
  * Explosive 7.62mm
  * Explosive .50 BMG
  * Explosive 10 gauge buckshot (unlike 12 gauge which has explosive slugs)
* Lincoln's repeater, a b-side to the lever action rifle
* Weapon modification table

## Changed
* Fat mines now use the standardized mini nuke code
  * Fat mines now have a base damage of exactly 100, being identical to demolition mini nukes
  * Fat mines now gib affected entities
* IV bags now use `setHealth` operations instead of dealing damage, preventing health duplication by just avoiding the damage
* The settings tool can now copy and paste the "paint" from paintable cables and fluid ducts
* Changed the way taint works
  * Instead of neon purple vines, taint is bow a greyish sludge
  * Taint now actively replaces blocks instead of growing along them
  * Taint is still limited in spread, however taint spread is lower underground, taint decays three times faster in intensity if the block is not exposed to air, making taint spread more along the surface
  * Taint has a 25% chance of splashing down when replacing a block with no supports, causing structures to collapse and taint to spread faster
  * Similar to soil sand, entities will sink in taint and get slowed down
  * The sludge consumeth
* `enableGuns` config option now applies to SEDNA system guns, simply canceling all gun-related keybinds
* Cinnabar dust, if registered by another mod, can now be acidized into cinnabar using hydrogen peroxide
* Copper wires, like AA and gold, can now be welded into dense wires
* Removed the crafting recipe for the small geothermal generator and ZPE generators
* Removed the gemothermal, ZPE and ambient radiation generators from the creative menu
* Disabled the horrid flicker on the quad rocket launcher's antenna, making steered mode look less terrible
* All non-legendary .357 revolvers now fire a quarter of a second faster

## Fixed
* Fixed animation errors on the MAS-36
* Fixed drone docks, requester and provider crates not dropping their contents when broken
* Fixed all missing texture errors that appear in the startup log
* Potentially fixed a crash with mekanism during the recipe change phase
* Removed the coke to heavy oil recipe for allowing infinite oil loops
  * Coke to syngas and coalgas recipes should be fine though, so they stay
* Potentially fixed another issue regarding NPCs firing belt-fed guns
* Chunk-loading drones may or may not be fixed
* Fixed disperser canisters not actually despawning on impact, endlessly spawning mist clouds
* Fixed issues where the new packet system didn't play nice with machines that are being sent packets by other machines, like watz segments and radar screens
* Fixed fat man's piston not being extended correctly in non-first person rendering when unloaded
