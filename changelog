## Added
* 10 gauge slug
* Shredder
  * A b-side for the autoshotgun
  * Fires 12 gauge, accelerated by plasma, which bursts on impact
  * Fragments move slowly and have damaging ricochet effects
  * Fragments keep the effects of the original shell (e.g. explosive shell will spawn a single explosive fragment)

## Changed
* Black powder bullets now have 75% base damage instead of 50%
* Ball and powder type rounds no longer have a bonus on headshot
* Shot and powder now does way less damage
* Some secret ammo types are now craftable
* Updated the assault rifle's texture
* Shooting at old CRT screens now breaks them

## Fixed
* Fixed `ITEM_TOOLTIP_SHOW_CUSTOM_NUKE` client config overriding `ITEM_TOOLTIP_SHOW_OREDICT` due to name overlap
* Fixed certain secret weapon creation condition not working properly
* Fixed artillery rockets getting stuck in the air when their target is not set to a block
* Fixed potential issue of ABMs getting stuck mid-flight when their target is destroyed prematurely
* Fixed mistakes in the fragment names for de_DE
* Fixed nitra rocket duplication only yielding one rocket
* Fixed rotary furnace not always properly showing the metal pouring effect
* Fixed T45 model not lifting its arms when a new gun is held
  * Like previously, due to the archaic nature of the model, the rotations are not very precise, and will most likely break when holding an akimbo gun
* Potentially fixed an issue where cargo planes do not successfully spawn on lower render distances
