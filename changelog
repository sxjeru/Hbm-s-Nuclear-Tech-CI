## Added
* Refueling station
  * Like a charging station, but for fluids

## Changed
* Updated chinese localization
* Particle detectors now print an error for when the recipe could not be completed
* Night Vision Goggles toggles with armor HUD
* Removed "no ore dict data" line from tooltips with extended view enabled
* Added a client config called `GUN_ANIMATION_SPEED` which allows the speed of gun animations to be changed
  * Mostly for debugging, since it only applies to the bus animation system, things like smoke trails and muzzle flashes are unaffected
* Item filters can now filter by bedrock ore grade
* Meteorite dungeons now use a new structure system
  * The rooms have been completely changed, and the dungeons are no longer single-level with fixed room sizes
  * Dungeons no longer lag the game to hell when generating
* Decimated bobmazon
  * All books have been merged into one with way fewer offers
  * Sells things like basic gear, MREs, plushies, snow globes, and certain things only found in worldgen like jungle tree saplings and NTM flowers (including mustard willow)
* Each acidizer recipe now has a "productivity" value which is the percent chance that the effectiveness upgrades use, instead of a fixed 5% per level
  * This means that certain recipes like re-crystallizing gems no longer allow for item duping
  * Due to duping no longer being a concern, productivity rates for certain recipes can now be much higher
  * Things like sawdust to cordite have a 75% chance of not using the input at level 3
  * Effectiveness no longer increases acid consumption (since many recipes now use the acidizer like a solid output "mixer") but instead adds +200% power consumption per level
  * Effectiveness can be configured with the recipe and caps out at 99% (since 100% would just print free items)
* Chemical dyes can now also be made with light oil
* There's now statistics for creating legendary weapons and ammo, stepping on landmines and firing guns
* Assembly templates no longer specify whether they are persistent and volatile, since volatile templates haven't existed in years
* Obliterated the HTR-01 item for good
  * Idk why it still existed
* Skeletons, slimes and cybercrabs can no longer be gibbed, since they don't have flesh
* The template folder's description now uses flashing colors to make it harder to ignore
* Scaled swords no longer use 1.1 scale in the inventory, making them larger than the inventory slot
* Fissures can now be connected to fluid ducts, providing 1,000mB of lava per tick

## Fixed
* Fixed items being annihilated when shift clicking them into the particle source
* Fixed packet optimization not allowing packets to be sent when the day night cycle is halted
* Fixed particle detectors not always using power when they should
* Fixed rotary furnace voiding low pressure steam when dealing with input numbers not divisible by 100
* Fixed state leak causing smoke from the right akimbo weapon to glow when the first one is fired
* Fixed incorrect default values for new RBMK dials
* Fixed blast doors self-destructing when closing
* Fixed PA coils being in the wrong creative tab
* Fixed flux calculation for RBMKs being wrong, mainly affecting reactors using fast flux
