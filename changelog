## Changed
* All the never completed missile parts (20/20 fuselage, 20 warhead, 10 and 15 tec kerosene thrusters) have been removed
* The electric arc furnace now scrapes the vanilla furnace recipe list on server start in addition to postinit, making sure recipes added during postinit after NTM loads (like Thermal's ingots) are covered too

## Fixed
* Fixed GT6 compatibility watz pellets crashing due to misconfigured recipes
* Removed failed attempt at fixing the gun desync dupe which made things worse
