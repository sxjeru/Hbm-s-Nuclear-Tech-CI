## Changed
* After three quarters of a decade, three separate models, countless rebalances and hours of senseless yapping, the industrial generator has finally met its end. Suddenly, yet not unsurprisingly, on this here day the industrial generator has closed its eyes for the final time. It was a long and eventful journey, but as with all things in life, it too had to come to an end.
  * And this is why we can't ever have anything nice
* Rebalanced glyphids
  * We'll see how it goes
* Did some spring cleaning
  * Removed cloud residue (looked horrible, allowed for weird dupes and made no sense overall)
  * Removed bottle cap blocks (took up a ton of block IDs and nobody used those anyway)
  * Removed the config option for silos (the option no longer works anyway since the new silos use the structure component system)
  * Removed a few other minor things that won't be mentioned because nobody's gonna even notice their absence anyway
* Retextured the laser detonator to look more like the old detonator, but keeping the 3D model

## Fixed
* WarTec should now be compatible again
* Fixed the "Hold shift for more info" line appearing on fluid info when shift is held, and disappearing otherwise
