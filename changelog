## Changed
* Added more QMAW pages
* Removed most old particle accelerator blocks from the creative inventory

## Fixed
* Fixed wood burner only being able to create one ash pile per item burned, even when that item yields more, creating a backlog in the internal ash value
* Fixed some QMAW link icons not having the correct block lighting applied
