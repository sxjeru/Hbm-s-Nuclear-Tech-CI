## Fixed
* Fixed battery connection priority being broken, all battery blocks present during the previous updates will now have their priority default to LOW
* Fixed batteries sometimes ending up transferring themselves, wasting their entire receiving and sending speed on doing effectively nothing
  * Energy tracking is still a bit flakey so there could be issues that remain with buffer mode batteries, however the transfer caps should mitigate most potential issues
