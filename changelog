## Changed
* Large deposits (hematite, malachite, bauxite) and caves (sulfur, asbestos) can now be toggled in the config
* Removed recipes for most old particle accelerator parts
* Dense coils no longer have recipes either for the most part, all coils with no recipes can be recycled back into dense wires

## Fixed
* Fixed an issue where `/ntmreload` would load fluids after recipes, meaning that recipes using newly added fluids would not work correctly, as the fluids don't exist by the time the recipe is loaded
