## Added
* Glpyhids
  * Hives will spawn randomly in the world
  * Hives will constantly spawn new glyphids
  * If explosed to soot, hives will create glyphid scouts, which when far enough from another hive will explode and generate a new hive
  * Higher soot levels create stronger glyphids
  * Glyphids possess armor which has a chance of breaking off and fully abrosrbing damage
  * Each glyphid has five armor plates
  * Glyphid types include multiple tiers of melee glyphids as well as a few ranged ones, the scout, and a nuclear variant
* Compressor
  * Can compress fluids, turning them into higher pressure variants
  * Can also turn steam into higher pressure types
  * Vacuum refning now requires oil at 2 PU
  * Some chemical plant recipes also require compressed fluid, TATB requires sour gas at 1 PU and osmiridic solution requires hydrogen peroxide at 5 PU
* A new rocket artillery ammo type that creates volcanic lava on impact
* BDCL
  * A type of lubricant that is easy to make and can be used in hydraulic piston and electric press recipes instead of regular lubricant
* FBI drones
  * A configurable amount of drones can now spawn during FBI raids
  * They will hover over players, dropping bombs

## Changed
* Updated russian localization
* Fluid traits can now be configured, any fluid can now have any fluid with variable stats assigned to them
* Large explosions now load the central chunk they are in, this can be disabled in the config
* Burning leaded fuels now releases poisonous heavy metals into the atmosphere
* The pollution detector now displays rounded values
* More machines and especially destroyed ones now release soot
* The iGen has been rebalanced again, delete your machine config file for the changes to take effect
  * The lubrican power multiplier has been increased from 1.1 to 1.5
  * The fluid divisor has been lowered from 5,000 to 1,000, meaning the iGen now burns flammable liquids at full efficiency
* Removed the config for having an additional keybind for dashing, the keybind is now always active since it no longer conflicts with crouching
* Crucible recipes no longer use foundry scraps to visualize the recipes, instead they use a lava-like texture
* Fusion reactors are now made from welded magnets which are created by weling a cast steel plate onto a magnet
  * Due to the cost of the cast plates, fusion reactor magnets are now cheaper to compensate
  * Consequently, particle accelerators are now also cheaper due to being made from mostly fusion reactor magnets
* The blowtorch now consumes only 250mB per operation, allowing for up to 16 things to be welded with a single fill
* The page and notebook items have been replaced with more dynamic book items that get their data from NBT
* C4 can now be made by irradiating PVC
  * Play stupid games, win stupid prizes

## Fixed
* Fixed potential crash or logspam regarding the pollution handler
* Fixed missiles leaving behind a 3x3 grid of loaded chunks after being destroyed
* Fixed coal ore yielding coal in the crucible instead of making carbon
* Fixed a potential issue where BuildCraft generators can't supply the RF to HE converter
