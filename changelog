## Changed
* Sped up the electrolyzer, fluid electrolysis now takes 3 seconds instead of 5 and crystal processing now only takes 20 seconds instead of 50
* Increased electrolyzer pouring speed to 3 nuggets per tick instead of 1
* Deco blocks now only drop ingots 25% of the time
  * The incredibly common structures now only yield a few dozen free ingots instead of several stacks. How horrible!

## Fixed
* Fixed radar screens not working at all and potentially freezing the game
