## Added
* Pigeons
* Wood burner
  * Replaces the old combustion generator
  * A larger machine, has higher efficiency when burning logs or planks
  * Collects ashes at the same rate as ashpits
  * Also has an option to burn flammable liquids at 50% efficiency
* `/ntmrad`
  * `set` operator can change the radiation amount in the current chunk
  * `clear` operator will remove the radiation data from all loaded chunks
* Dense wires
  * Can be made in a crucible
  * Material cost is equivalent to 1 ingot
  * For ease of mass-production, 9-fold molds are also available
  * Used to craft hadron magnets, reducing crafting complexity be removing annoying upgrade recipes which make automation more complicated and needlessly inflate the amount of materials required for a magnet tier that isn't even the one that's being made

## Changed
* Changed many tool recipes that exclusively used polymer to now also accept bakelite
* Reduced the value of hematite and malachite blocks in the crucible down to one ingot
  * Hematite veins are still giant, so a single vein will still yield many stacks of iron
  * Malachite's rebalance was done to be consistent with the bedrock ores which now exist. Malachite veins are now larger to compensate.
* 1000mB of red mud now makes one ingot of iron in the coker
* Doubled coal bedrock ore's coal output to 8 coal
* A new config option now replaces the iron and copper bedrock ores in 528 mode with hematite and malachite
* the industrial generator now has three additional ports on its underside, meaning it is now a lot easier to properly automate all necessary IO
* Neodymium is now a valid crucible material
* Particle accelerators will now evenly distribute items using IO if both inputs are equal, making the antischrabidium recipe a lot easier to automate

## Fixed
* Pipe and power networks now force the chunk to be saved on transfer, ensuring that rapid changes in the fluid/energy level aren't lost when the tile entity is unloaded
